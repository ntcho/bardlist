working in one of the college’s many educational outreach programs and who are
committed to the idea of civic engagement. Guided by readings in education, we
will consider the inter-personal, cultural, social and ethical issues that
arise in the context of civic engagement in schools.  In particular, we will consider: What are our
personal and professional aspirations as teachers, tutors, mentors and leaders?
What systemic or other changes might we like to see in our civic engagement and
how might we best go about making or advocating for them? How can we improve
our own communication skills so that we become better and more skillful
presenters, listeners and responders? What are the potential challenges we may
face in supporting someone’s learning? Throughout this course we will emphasize
writing as a means of engaging with content, and we will workshop and critique
problems that you may experience and encounter in your outreach work. It will
include two virtual “days of writing” with Bard High School Early College –
Newark dates TBD), when course participants will lead on-line writing workshops
for students. The course is required of all junior-year MAT 4+1 students and is
recommended for tutors and mentors in TLS education programs. It will be graded
pass/fail and carries two credits (non-distributional).","Bard BA/MAT 4 + 1 Program","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/current/mat.htm"

the Experimental Humanities concentration. Modernity is often described in
terms of the development of science’s experimental method and in terms of the
proliferation of populations living in urban environments. What does
experimentation have to do with how communities and publics organize their
lives in cities? How have certain populations been disempowered and
marginalized, and how have other aspects of civic life, such as politics, infrastructure,
the environment, cultural production, and public health been impacted by the
relationship between science and technology and urban life? This course studies
two twinned concepts, “the city” and “the experiment,” from a variety of
different disciplinary perspectives to interrogate the distances between
experimentation and lived experience, theory and practice, and the humanities,
the arts, and the sciences. Collaborative and interdisciplinary in both form
and content, this is an OSUN Network-Collaborative course that will involve
sustained interactions between students at Bard College and students in a
parallel urban sociology course at the European Humanities University in
Lithuania. Culminating in the study of “urban laboratories” as sites of sociological
experimentation, the course will challenge students at Bard and EHU to
collaboratively, imaginatively, and experimentally engage with concrete civic
problems. Readings will stretch from early modernity and the Enlightenment
through urgent contemporary texts, and will situate artistic works by authors
such as Thomas More, Italo Calvino, Octavia Butler,
and N. K. Jemisin alongside theoretical, historical,
and critical texts by Francis Bacon, Augusto Boal, Jane Jacobs, Michel de Certeau, Doreen Massey, and Bruno Latour.

shapes state power, policy, citizenship, rights, and modes of governance, and
how, in turn, the state shapes gender relations, inequalities, politics, and
identities. Throughout we will approach gender as intertwined with other
dimensions of power, difference, and inequality, especially race and class. The
course also investigates how feminist movements have engaged the state. We
consider the challenges they have posed to policy, politics, and notions of
citizenship. And we ask how feminists have made claims on the state and tried
to use the state to address gender inequality and patriarchal domination. While
some of the course will focus on the United States, we also examine the state
and feminist politics in various national contexts, including colonial and
post-colonial states, and we will consider conflict within and among global
feminist movements and within feminist theory. How have these movements thought
about solidarity and worked toward feminist visions of social justice? This
course is part of the OsUN Transnational Feminism,
Solidary, and Social Justice initiative. We will occasionally collaborate with
linked courses at universities in several countries. Within this expansive

global course) An introduction to debates about freedom of
expression. What is ‘freedom of speech’? Is there a right to say
anything? Why? We will investigate who has had this right, where and why, and
what it has had to do in particular with politics and culture. What powers does
speech have, and for what? Debates about censorship, dissidence and protest,
hate speech, the First Amendment and Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights will be obvious starting points, but we will also explore some
less obvious questions: about faith and the secular, the rights of minorities,
migration, surveillance, speaking and political agency, law and politics,
social media, and the force(s) of words. In asking about the status of the
speaking human subject, we will look at the ways in which the subject of
rights, and indeed the thought of human rights itself, derives from an
experience of claiming, speaking, and speaking up. These questions will be
examined, if not answered, across a variety of philosophical, legal,
journalistic, and political texts, with a heavy dose of case studies (many of
them happening right now) and readings in contemporary critical and legal
theory. Taught in parallel with classes at Bard College
Berlin (Germany), Al-Quds Bard College for Liberal Arts and Sciences in Abu Dis

impact civic participation. The class reflects a balance between study and
practice of engagement which includes interrogating theoretical notions of
civic life while also empowering students to be active participants in the
communities in which they are situated. 
The culminating project asks students to propose a civic engagement
project in their home or local community. This course will feature workshops,

Roosevelt warned, “People who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of
which dictatorships are made.” Today, the COVID-19 crisis and mass unemployment
have once again exposed the pervasive pathologies in the economy, such as
inequality, poverty, and discrimination that reproduce systemic racial, gender
and environmental injustice. Roosevelt responded to the economic calamity of
his time—the Great Depression—with far-reaching economic policies and an appeal
for what he called a Second (Economic) Bill of Rights that led with the right
to decent and remunerative employment. “Jobs for All” was a signature demand
during the Civil Rights era, when Martin Luther King, Jr. and Coretta Scott
King insisted that unemployment is a key force for racial subjugation. Today,
the Job Guarantee has been called perhaps the most crucial component of the
Green New Deal Resolution, a program that ensures a just transition for all
workers and an antidote to systemic racial and gender discrimination that
emerges from labor markets.  This
interdisciplinary course traces the history of the struggle to secure the right
to employment for  all.
It will focus on the economic, legal, and policy developments in the United
States, and will introduce students to some international policy initiatives

proposals and concrete policies have advanced the goal of equity and economic
justice. Students will read legislative documents, economic analyses, policy
proposals, and program reviews.  This

sovereignty posits that legitimate political authority rests with the people,
the very people who are subject to that same authority. It is the principle

methods to interrogate this principle, examining its origins in antiquity; the
philosophical arguments, both ancient and modern, that have been advanced for
and against it as a governing ideal; and the relationship between this
principle and the practice of self-governance in several particular cases
(examples may include ancient Athens, the early American republic, Weimar
Germany, and India’s anti-colonial struggle). Questions we address include:
What constitutes “a people”? In what sense can a people be regarded as
sovereign and how is inclusion within, or exclusion from, this group
determined? In what sense has rule by the people been regarded as legitimate or
good? In what sense and to what degree do institutions of representation such
as legislatures embody the ideal of popular sovereignty? How is the will of the
people conceptualized and expressed? What is the relationship, if any, between
“public opinion” and popular sovereignty? The course will encompass both
theoretical analysis and empirical research, aiming to bring diverse discourses
into conversation. Readings will be drawn from a range of historical periods,

American.” The term was the modest contribution of a community of Asian
students in California’s Bay Area who had been inspired by the self-fashioning
initiative of the civil rights and Black Power movements of the 1950s and
1960s. Ignoring the arbitrariness and historical divisions implicit in the term
“Asian”—and defiantly rejecting longstanding terms of derision such as
“Oriental” or “Asiatic”—these students conceived of the Asian American as a new
(and newly empowered) citizen, and the moment itself represented a turning
point in the history of Asians living in the United States. The decades since
have brought confusion—albeit a productive kind of confusion. Nowhere have the
parameters of Asian American identity been contested more thoroughly than in
discussions of literature. During this semester-long course, we will conduct a

poetry carved on the walls of immigration detention centers and travel
reportage to experimental fiction, film, graphic novels, zines and memoir.
Throughout this course, we will also pay close attention to how different

slippery qualities of this category of identification—even those who wrote
before the category existed. We will pursue twin narratives: one which accepts

forms, and activism of indigenous communities and feminist thinkers. We will
explore conceptual, theoretical and political vocabularies that we need to
learn in order to understand these visions that go beyond conventional
political thought and practice. The second half of the course will apply these
insights on the analysis of a novel project of feminist decolonization that is
currently being practiced in Rojava, or Syrian Kurdistan: “democratic
confederalism.”  The goal of this
liberation struggle is to generate anti-statist, sustainable and feminist lives
within a region and an international context fractured by nation-states and the
increasingly more racialized manifestations of the latter. By putting
indigenous resurgence theory developed largely in North America in conversation
with this new feminist anticolonial imaginary practiced in the Middle East, the
course will also explore the internationalist futures of political struggles
for emancipation. This course is part of the Rethinking Place:

Recent events have challenged the status and role of police, highlighting
persistent problems of abuse – particularly against African Americans – and our
historic failure to address them. At the same time, the movement to reform the
police faces powerful countervailing political, economic and legal forces. Law
defines the power of the police and its limits, but critics of the left and
right show how the law fails to account for the reality or cover the full range
of a police action. Can you walk away from the policeman who stops you on the
street? You may have a Constitutional right, but other laws that insulate the
police may prevent you from ever exercising that right. This course will
explore the laws that have empowered police, those that have attempted to limit
them and limits of the law, itself, in theory and practice. The theoretical
readings include writings by Louis Althusser and Georgio
Agamben, as well as others who have engaged their
theories. We will also read works by sociologists, criminologists and legal
scholars, including Loic Wacquant, William Stuntz and Egon Bittner. After
the theoretical and historical exploration of the material, the class will
focus on several themes including: street encounters, search and seizure,
accountability for abuses, the role of the federal government, policing
immigrants, racism and others challenges of Black Lives Matter. The course
material will include video and audio of police encounters as well as court
decisions, contemporary legal analyses and work of advocacy organizations
confronting police. This course is part of the Racial Justice Initiative, an

locating it within the historical and global processes of colonialism. By
drawing out the scope of the issue and its interconnections, we hope to
understand better the local and international solidarities required to address
it. Indeed, Black liberationist leaders from W.E.B. Dubois to Stokeley Carmichael, Malcolm X, James Baldwin, Martin
Luther King, and Angela Davis have articulated the demand for racial justice
against a global canvas, and in ways that underlined its continuity with the
anti-colonial movements of their day. They saw a fundamental continuity between
militarism and racialized carceral practice abroad
and at home, and were inspired by Afro-Asian decolonization and the vision of a
decolonized world order articulated by the Bandung Conference. In recent months
the apparatus of global counterinsurgency and the paramilitary arm of border
patrol have been mobilized against protesters on the streets of Washington DC
and Portland. There has long been a reciprocal, mutually constitutive
relationship between regimes of territorial expansion, slaveholding, and the
elimination of indigenous peoples on the North American continent and overseas.
Taking an anthropological approach, and suspending the dichotomy between
foreign and domestic belied by an ever-expanding frontier, the course will
examine the protracted, structuring effects of racialised
practices of warfare, colonial administration, and exploitation on the US
Mainland and in its overseas colonies, territories, protectorates, and bases in
the Pacific, East Asia, and the Caribbean. We will study empire not only as a

structuring the experience and lifeworlds of its subjects

and is now the highest on record. Since 2000, 95% of income gains have gone to the
top 1% whose share remains at an all-time high, even during economic downturns.
Economists have only recently acknowledged and turned their attention to these
facts. There is still much uncertainty regarding the causes and consequences of
such disturbing trends, let alone the potential economic policies required to
combat inequality and restore social justice. This course presents a survey of
the landmark theories of economic growth and income distribution focusing on
their interconnectedness. Students are invited to explore the causes and
consequences of economic inequality from a variety of analytical perspectives,
to judge the current social division based on ethical and moral values, and to
discuss concrete actions to bring about positive change toward a just society.
Through what processes is income created and distributed? Why has growth become
so biased toward the very few? Is there such a thing as a balanced or equitable
growth and, if so, what does it require? What are extractive and predatory governments?
Why do policies designed to address inequality end up exacerbating its already
unprecedented levels and leading to further, more pronounced social class
division and concentration of power? In answering these questions, we focus on
the case of the United States, one of the most unequal economies in the world,
and complement our analysis with international comparisons. This is an OSUN Online Class, taught online and open to Bard

Wars of Religion and several financial bubbles burst. It looks at the social
groups most associated with spreading hearsay, women, “the common people,” and
the enslaved, and at those groups, identified usually by religious difference,
who were made scapegoats to the majority populations in crisis periods. As a
study of what passed for information and its changing media, students sample
different methods of socio-cultural analysis to chart its transmission and
reception. The entangled histories of rumor, heresy, disease, and financial
panic suggest themselves as precursors of mass media propaganda, agitprop, and
fake-news. But they also indicate a world in which the body, bodiliness, and
body metaphors were central to truth claims, whether folk wisdom, common sense,
or princely decree. These phenomena are intimately tied to state-building, the
rise of the police, and administrative centralization. The course looks
squarely at cyclical histories of hatred, of strangers, religious minorities,
and racial others, with the understanding that contemporaries did not view
their beliefs as such, but rather as simple or prophetic truth. Time,
information, knowledge, and communication, at play together, are the critical
ingredients to historiographical understanding. Students will answer the

that it can function to normalize racialized and gendered structures of exclusion
and privation? And what models of care, collectivity, flexibility, and access
have been, and might be posed, against this, through the speculative work of
chronic theorists and disability justice advocates and through hard-fought

Is there a right to say anything? Why? We will investigate who has had this

will also explore some less obvious questions: about faith and the secular, the
rights of minorities, migration, surveillance, speaking and political agency,

in all societies, there seem to be individuals who violate these norms and
experience sanctions for doing so. A sanction may be a reward or punishment for
one behaving in such a way. However, not all violations of norms are
sanctioned. The sociological study of deviance examines how certain people and
behaviors come to be defined and labeled as deviant in certain contexts. The
course addresses four critical questions: Who or what defines and decides what
norms must be upheld and what is deviant? How do those responsible for
identifying and sanctioning deviant behavior understand or explain the sources
and causes of deviance? What are the consequences for deviants of being so
identified and treated? And lastly, how is deviant behavior socially controlled
informally (e.g. by the family, peers, or fashion) and through formal
organizations (e.g. by the state, law, schools, and police)? Students will
learn to critically analyze the problems of definition, identification,
explanation, and social reactions to violations of institutional expectations.
Throughout the course, we will discuss how issues of class, race, gender, and
cultural and historical contexts relate to deviance to understand how standards
of normality and deviance always involve relations of power and unequal
opportunities to partake in the rewards of living up to the standards of social
respectability. Topics include: mental illness and mental disabilities;

contexts. It features in a range of discourses, such as familial, academic,
political, religious, corporative, medical, and commercial, to name a few.
Often, it addresses various kinds of needs (e.g. health) and concerns (e.g. the
environment). Linguists call words such as “care” polysemous because they have
several meanings. In this two-credit course, we will explore the multiple uses
and meanings that “care” has in a variety of social contexts, practices and
sites in which we come to participate and interact. Our task is two-fold:
First, through our weekly readings and discussions, we try to understand what
the concept means and the “work” it does in each specific context we analyze;
for example, in philosophy, medical practice, disability studies, self-help
books, political debates (e.g. welfare to the poor), the activism and
organizing of social movements (e.g. #BlackLivesMatter), “self-care” guides in
social media, advertisements of agencies that provide care services for the
elderly, and Human Resources materials from places of work, among others.
Second, while we critically engage with these materials to assess how care
“travels” through these different contexts and what it accomplishes, students
will search for other texts, practices, types of paid or unpaid work, symbols,
situations or sites where something that could be called “care” might be
happening but without explicitly mentioning the word. By the end of the
semester, together as a class, we will “curate” and compile a catalogue of “care”
examples, or as sociologists say, of possible “operationalizations” of the
concept. Individually, each student will write a final analytical paper about a
particular use and meaning of “care” that traces how the concept “works”: What
does it accomplish and for whom? What kinds of relationships does it allow or
preclude? How does it provide for or burden the needs or concerns it is
supposed to alleviate? How is it distributed, accessed, or acquired?","Hate Studies Initiative","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/current/hate.htm"

“identity politics” has become a mainstay of contemporary political discourse
and a subject of controversy. In scholarly and public debates, it is used to
make sense of phenomena as diverse as multiculturalism, movements for racial
justice, feminism, white nationalism, and violent political conflicts. While
many believe that our identities are crucial sources of knowledge and
solidarity, others critique identity politics for undermining social unity or
foreclosing the possibility of shared struggle. How do our identities,
including race, gender, class, and nationality, shape our understandings of the
social world and our ability to change it? How are these identities formed, and
under what conditions can they be transformed? What kinds of understanding and
solidarity are possible across identities? This course explores these questions
through a study of texts by authors such as Patricia Hill Collins, Audre Lorde,
Judith Butler, Jodi Dean, Cristina Beltrán, Tamara Nopper, and Olúfẹ́mi Táíwò.","Engaged Liberal Arts and Sciences (ELAS)","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/current/elas.htm"

rather than seeing disability and sickness simply as a limitation or failure to
reach a “healthy” norm, what can the experience and often hidden histories of
the disabled and chronically ill, as well as those who fight for their care,
reveal about social structures, ideologies, and patterns of circulation that
cannot be seen otherwise? What would it mean to move beyond the political and
ideological centrality of the idea of health and to instead understand the way
that it can function to normalize racialized and gendered structures of
exclusion and privation? And what models of care, collectivity, flexibility,
and access have been, and might be posed, against this, through the speculative
work of chronic theorists and disability justice advocates and through
hard-fought campaigns and daily ad hoc solutions alike? In addition to
grappling with a range of historical and theoretical texts, we’ll also center

this course, we shall approach this question both directly and obliquely. We
begin with Homer’s Iliad and with philosophical accounts from 5th
century Athens. Should courage be understood the same way in all contexts? Is a
warrior’s courage the same as that of a philosopher or a legislator? Who is
truly courageous, the one who defends the regime, the one who critiques it, or
both? Is the courage of Hektor or Achilles the same
as that of Socrates or Antigone? In this course, our discussion of courage will
proceed through close readings of philosophical and essayistic texts, both

representations in literature and film (Homer’s Iliad, Sophocles’ Antigone,
Brecht’s Mother Courage, Fugard’s The
Island, Zinneman’s High Noon, Bertolucci’s The Conformist). Among other things, we

Avatamsaka Flower Garland Sutra, everybody is depicted as a jewel, infinitely
connected through space and time. If one dot is put on one jewel, it mirrored
in all jewels. Are we one or are we many jewels? This year‘s Courage to
Be With: Risking the World course examines the intersection of self and
other, taking into account both the notion of oneness (I am you and you are me)
and duality (I am not you and you are not me). How can we overcome differences
realizing our shared human nature? Sangha, the community, is one of the three
jewels in Buddhism. We can not be without the other, in fact, we are asked to
polish each other. Any tension that arises, shows our own conditioning. What is
that troubling self? How can we BE without standing in our way and for that
matter practicing harmony?","The Common Courses","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/current/commoncourses.htm"

will investigate poetry's particular power to connect us to places, whether
they are near (the landscape around us), distant (faraway places or remembered lands),
or imaginary (worlds we conjure or invent). Through our reading of an eclectic
mix of poets, as well as through our own writing, we will explore the way
language can render what can be experienced by the senses and evoke what is
absent, dreamed of, or recalled. Some of the questions we will pursue include,
How can poetry enable us to ""see"" more clearly what is around us?
What tools does poetry offer us in order to honor and find meaning in places,
whether real or imagined? How can poetry, in its delicate dance with memory and
imagination, render and make real a place that cannot be seen or from which we
are separated? In what way might we (as readers, as writers) turn to poetry as
a means of exploring the world(s) in which we live? This course is designed for
students from Afghanistan.","The Common Courses","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/current/commoncourses.htm"

United States have famously been referred to as “distant neighbors” because of
the deep animosity and mistrust prevalent in U.S.-Latin American
relations.  The Latin Americans are quick to put the blame for this troubled
relationship on a long history of American aggression towards Latin
America.  That history dates to the Monroe Doctrine of 1823, which
declared America’s intentions to control the political destiny of Latin
America.  It led to the annexation of a big portion of Mexican territory
and the creation of the American colonies of Cuba and Puerto Rico.  For
their part, Americans argue that Latin America is incapable of governing
itself, forcing the US to intervene in the region to deal with such problems as
revolutions, immigration, drug-trafficking, and human rights abuses.  The
class will explore a variety of theories and concepts in international
relations--especially imperialism, moralism, realism, and dependency--to
understand the dynamics of U.S.-Latin American relations.  Along the way,
the course will also provide a window into how Latin America has responded to
the American attempt to seek hegemony over its southern neighbors and a broad
overview of the issues that bring the U.S. and Latin America into conflict at
the present time.","Latin American and Iberian Studies","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/current/lais.html"

course will explore poetry from the biblical period up to the present day by
looking at a handful of distinct historical movements. Students will begin with
a deep dive into the Psalms and other examples of biblical verse. There will
also be a particular focus on the poetry, culture, and influences of the
medieval Hebrew poets who wrote in Andalusian Spain, the Eastern European
Yiddish writers from the first decades of the twentieth century, and
concurrently, Osip Mandelstam and other Soviet Jewish writers composing in the
shadow of Stalin. Towards the end of the semester, we’ll compare the life and
work of the Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish with that of his Israeli
counterpart Yehuda Amichai. Students will be able to track how the ghost of the
Psalms continues to resound in later Jewish poetry, and in this spirit, to
consider the relationship between poetry and prayer. There will be both
creative and critical assignments in relation to engagement with these texts,
and the class will culminate in students writing a final project on a
contemporary poet of their choice.","Jewish Studies","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/current/js.html"

system since the advent of agriculture and urbanization 10,000 years ago. This
course explores how natural and human systems are connected, and how global
problems such as climate change, biodiversity loss, species extinction are
linked with one another and with social problems such as financial instability,
widening economic inequality, food insecurity, intensifying conflict, and
public health. We review the empirical evidence of these “wicked problems”, and
introduce core concepts and methodologies from natural, and social sciences
perspectives, together with practical skills that are required to tackle these
issues. We will contemplate alternative political and socioeconomic options
(from indigenous knowledge to shared socioeconomic pathways) and will explore
how impacts of these decisions on future natural and human systems can be
assessed (foresight work). Issues will be considered at a variety of
scales—from the level of individual responsibility to the local, regional,
national, and global dimensions. The course includes a community service
component, labs, and guest lectures.  It
will be co-taught by instructors in the natural and social sciences.","Environmental Studies","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/current/es.htm"

explore those fundamental limits, the robust and weak elements of existing and

for global progress, ranging from food security to women’s empowerment to
climate change action. One way to achieve these goals is through social
enterprise: creating for-profit and non-profit organizations whose mission is
to advance one or more of the SDGs. This collaborative, cross-institution
course explores the global drivers of change that led to the UN SDG’s, with a
particular focus on Social Enterprise solutions. Bard students will work with
and learn from classes in Colombia, Kyrgyzstan, Palestine and other countries
through a mixture of synchronous on-line, weekly global class, combined with
in-person, project-based learning. The synchronous portion of the course
provides a critical introduction to the SDGs, and the forces behind global
change, ranging from climate to technology to income inequality. The
experiential component on the course involves the students conducting shared
research projects on local enterprise solutions to the SDG’s. Student teams
will choose a sector of interest—energy, food, affordable housing, immigration,
toxic exposure—and map the Hudson Valley ecosystem of for-profit and non-profit
enterprises seeking to address these challenges. The projects will include deep
dives into the strategies pursued by select enterprises within their sector.
The students will produce a final report for distribution to the social
enterprises within their sector. This will be an OSUN Network Collaborative
Course, hybrid in structure, with one global synchronous online session per
week, and one in-person session each week at Bard. The synchronous on-line
session will be taught by Bard MBA Professor Hunter Lovins, meeting one day per
week, simultaneously in all schools online for 90 minutes. The course will have
an in-person, 90-minute section once per week taught by co-instructors to the

climate change impacts on crop production and land use change. We review crop simulation
models, their applications and limitations, as well as expectations for the
influence of elevated CO2 on crop yield and nutrition. We then turn to a
discussion of the role that agriculture can play in climate change mitigation,
given the large greenhouse gas emissions associated with farming systems. This
takes us to an in-depth discussion of soil carbon management, nitrogen
fertilizer, and trade-offs between emissions from various reduction strategies.
Finally, we will investigate the strategies being put forth regarding climate
change adaptation, including the role of traditional seeds and genetically
modified crops, agroforestry, and system resilience, with major implications
for future food production.","Environmental Studies","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/current/es.htm"

Africa, providing a foundational understanding of some of their key historical
and contemporary dynamics. Broadly interdisciplinary in nature, this course
explores questions of ethno-linguistic diversity, religious practice, gender
and sexuality, national identity and state formation, economic development, and
the environment. Critical to such an array of questions will be to complement
academic readings with regular exposure to the region’s visual and literary
cultural production in the form of film, novels, and more. Students will also
learn how major disciplines in the social sciences, humanities, and the arts
take up the region as a research site. No prior background knowledge is
required. The course is designed to either stand alone as the only foray a
student may take into the study of the Middle East and North Africa, or to
serve as a springboard for pursuing additional courses or moderating in MES.
Assignments will include response papers, student group presentations, film
reviews, and tracking a contemporary issue of the student’s choosing.","Middle Eastern Studies","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/current/middleeast.htm"

rights discourses through the lens of alternate, imagined worlds, proximate to
ours yet not our own. While such discourses often, and importantly, rely upon
the consensus that human rights are inherent, we will practice defamiliarizing
and reexamining the multiple meanings of categories such as “the universal,”
“the human,” “the citizen,” and “the alien” as well as the production of
socially constructed concepts and lived realities such as race and gender.
Combining theoretical texts with works of speculative and science fiction, we
will come into contact with new forms of physical bodies, social
collectivities, legal systems, territorial borders and technologies. At turns
utopian and dystopian, these other worlds invite us to approach both human
rights violations and acts of advocacy in the present from the radical
perspective of contingent futures or counterfactual pasts. We will ask such
questions as: What can we learn about human rights as an international movement
from interplanetary coalitions and regimes of power? And how can
representations of non-human or humanoid consciousness help us reframe our
definitions of freedom and dignity? Given the centrality of data to the
documentation of human rights abuses and of law to their protection, how can
fictional works advance human rights on the plane of the imagination? In
answering, we will address themes that include imperialism and colonialism,
race, gender, sexuality, bio-politics, immigration, globalization, and
environmental justice. Authors may include such figures as Thomas More, Mary
Shelley, Isaac Asimov, W.E.B. Du Bois, Ursula K. LeGuin, Octavia Butler, Samuel

introduction to debates about freedom of expression. What is ‘freedom of

this right, where and why, and what it has had to do in particular with
politics and culture. What powers does speech have, and for what? Debates about
censorship, dissidence and protest, hate speech, the First Amendment and
Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights will be obvious
starting points, but we will also explore some less obvious questions: about
faith and the secular, the rights of minorities, migration, surveillance,
speaking and political agency, law and politics, social media, and the force(s)
of words. In asking about the status of the speaking human subject, we will
look at the ways in which the subject of rights, and indeed the thought of

persistent problems of abuse – particularly against African Americans – and our
historic failure to address them. At the same time, the movement to reform the
police faces powerful countervailing political, economic and legal forces. Law
defines the power of the police and its limits, but critics of the left and
right show how the law fails to account for the reality or cover the full range
of a police action. Can you walk away from the policeman who stops you on the
street? You may have a Constitutional right, but other laws that insulate the
police may prevent you from ever exercising that right. This course will
explore the laws that have empowered police, those that have attempted to limit
them and limits of the law, itself, in theory and practice. The theoretical
readings include writings by Louis Althusser and Georgio Agamben, as well as
others who have engaged their theories. We will also read works by
sociologists, criminologists and legal scholars, including Loic Wacquant,
William Stuntz and Egon Bittner. After the theoretical and historical
exploration of the material, the class will focus on several themes including:
street encounters, search and seizure, accountability for abuses, the role of

motels, warming shelters and county jails. We’ll interrogate how, at extremis,

and daunting problem for human rights. Pain, violence, victimization, and
injustice have long been a part of human reality.  Can we change, or are we doomed to repeat
ourselves until the end of time? The answer is not obvious. But one thing is
certain: as long as we stay in the cave, in obscurity, and only look at
shadows, we are not going to resolve this conundrum. Going into the world,
trying to look at it and describe it, is the only way for us to escape that
cavern of ideology, of disempowering shadows and ghosts. This process of trying
to understand what we see, how we see it and how we describe it, brings us
closer to a resolution – by action – of this fundamental problem. In order to
reach the point of rawness where we reformulate for ourselves what observation
and description are, we must challenge the predicament and predictability of
known methods and forms.  We need to position
ourselves in a no-man’s land, beyond traditional specializations in knowledge
and practice. In this seminar, we set out to re-appropriate reality, to get at
perception before it has been shaped as expression, to see images in the heart
and eye before they harden as categories, styles, definitions – and if it is
possible to do so, to reconcile the layers of meanings and to pull from all
these contradictions some organized process, where the documentary act begins.
We will focus on visual awareness, not as an illustration of ideas, but as a
seed for ideas in themselves. We will try, through examples and assignments, to
investigate how non-professionals can use not only current technologies but
also new visual attitudes, so that reports and communications can escape their

way as to escape its own ghetto and be made attractive, visually and

sympathies at an outpost of the Empire, from a murderer to a lover, we will
look at the site of this splitting, and the process and consequences of it, at
the loss of the wholeless (if there ever was one) and see the fate of the
various and variously divided selves.  Our
reading list will include works (and selections from works) such as Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Hyde by R.L. Stevenson, Faust by Goethe, Waiting for the Barbarians by
J.M. Coetzee, Days of Abandonment by Elena Ferrante, Mimic Men by V.S Naipaul,
Samskara by U.R. Anantamurthy, Hamlet by Shakespeare, The Divided Self, R.D.
Laing, Giovanni’s Room by James Baldwin, and Crime and Punishment by Fyodor
Dostoevsky. This is an OSUN Online Class, taught online and open to Bard
students and students from OSUN partner institutions.","Human Rights","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/current/hrp.html"

and design history, political ecology, and histories of radical organizing and
mobilization that focus on the idea and experience of disability and sickness.
In traversing these materials, this seminar aims to to ask: rather than seeing
disability and sickness simply as a limitation or failure to reach a “healthy”
norm, what can the experience and often hidden histories of the disabled and
chronically ill, as well as those who fight for their care, reveal about social
structures, ideologies, and patterns of circulation that cannot be seen
otherwise? What would it mean to move beyond the political and ideological
centrality of the idea of health and to instead understand the way that it can
function to normalize racialized and gendered structures of exclusion and
privation? And what models of care, collectivity, flexibility, and access have
been, and might be posed, against this, through the speculative work of chronic
theorists and disability justice advocates and through hard-fought campaigns and
daily ad hoc solutions alike? In addition to grappling with a range of
historical and theoretical texts, we’ll also center on artistic, political, and
critical tactics that work to draw out those hidden causes and the roles that
conceptions of health, hygiene, and security play in reinforcing models of
restricted access and normalized violence.","Human Rights","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/current/hrp.html"

people, by way of a rich array of philosophical, anthropological, literary, and
cinematic representations, from the 1940s to the present. We will consider how
these groups have been constructed but also how writers and intellectuals
within these groups have imagined themselves in response to persecution and
oppression. By challenging the injustices of fascism, racism, and colonial
subjugation, they have made themselves felt as historical subjects, changing
not only France, but the way we think about identity, the construction of
“race”, belonging, and the nature of citizenship. Readings by (among others)

What is apartheid? Is it primarily an analogy to a period of rule in 20th-century
South Africa and Namibia? Is it a legal concept that exists independently of
any similarities and differences with apartheid in South Africa? Why have
leading international, Palestinian, and Israeli human rights organizations
found that Israeli officials are committing the crime of apartheid? What are
the political, analytical, and legal implications of this finding? Through
close scrutiny of recent reports on Israeli apartheid by leading human rights
organizations, including Human Rights Watch, al-Haq, and B’Tselem, as well as
criticisms of those reports, students will survey the central issues concerning
apartheid in Israel-Palestine. These issues include legal as opposed to popular
conceptions of the crime, defining the perpetrators and victims of the crime,
understanding the relationship between apartheid framings and settler colonial
framings of Israel-Palestine, arguments over the geographical scope of the crime,
and whether Israeli practices in the occupied territory are committed by the
Israeli state or by a distinct regime that is separate from it. Guest speakers
may include representatives of leading Israeli, Palestinian, and international

political authority rests with the people, the very people who are subject to
that same authority. It is the principle underlying the idea of a government
that would be “of the people, by the people, and for the people.” In this
course, we employ a diversity of materials and methods to interrogate this
principle, examining its origins in antiquity; the philosophical arguments,
both ancient and modern, that have been advanced for and against it as a
governing ideal; and the relationship between this principle and the practice
of self-governance in several particular cases (examples may include ancient
Athens, the early American republic, Weimar Germany, and India’s anti-colonial
struggle). Questions we address include: What constitutes “a people”? In what
sense can a people be regarded as sovereign and how is inclusion within, or
exclusion from, this group determined? In what sense has rule by the people
been regarded as legitimate or good? In what sense and to what degree do
institutions of representation such as legislatures embody the ideal of popular
sovereignty? How is the will of the people conceptualized and expressed? What
is the relationship, if any, between “public opinion” and popular sovereignty?
The course will encompass both theoretical analysis and empirical research,
aiming to bring diverse discourses into conversation. Readings will be drawn
from a range of historical periods, geographical regions, and modes of
investigation (philosophy, history, political theory, political science).
Authors may include Aristotle, Bateman, Bhattacherjee, the Federalists, Gandhi,
Gerring, Hobbes, Katznelson, Plato, Rousseau, Tocqueville, Taylor, and
Wheatley. This course will be taught in person on the Annandale campus, and
will be linked with a parallel course taught at Bard College Berlin, allowing
for occasional joint meetings and student collaboration across campuses. We
will also host several guest speakers. This is

through racialized political economic of normative sexuality and that Marxist
theory had failed to account for the exchange and use values attached to the
material labors and cultural representations of non-white bodies. In short,
dominant social theory had not provided any language that helped queer scholars

intersecting marginalization vis a vis the dominant culture ortheir

Ferguson’s wake came Black Queer, Asian American Queer, Indigenous Queer and

the world outside of China slowly awakened to the gravity and breadth of the
COVID-19 threat, an old, seemingly forgotten book stealthily roused itself from
the depths of high school curricula and ascended the bestseller lists in dozens
of countries. Albert Camus’s The Plague, a beautifully rendered story of
quarantine, loss and resilience, was suddenly all too relevant. But there is an
entire world of thought and feeling to be explored beyond this most timely
novel. In this seminar course, we will combine a close reading of a variety of
Camus’s literary and philosophical texts with aspects of his biography and
first-person writing and travel writing/reporting. There are so many ways to
apply his work, which has aged so well compared to his contemporaries, to our
current crises: from the absurdity of living and creating life-affirming
meaning at a time when it increasingly feels like we’ve been thrust in a simulation,
to his conception of political rebellion and resistance to authoritarian
regimes, to his thirst for romance and love of nature (specifically sea and
sun) at a moment of social atomization and climate degradation—as well as the
struggle for dignity during armed conflict and war. As Camus reminds us, there
is much more to life than the absurdity of our identities and circumstances and
we make our own meaning in the struggle to discover it.","Human Rights","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/current/hrp.html"

either a conjured one, alien to the voices of the text, or a direct speech by one
of the many speakers in the text. Quotation marks are the site of
ventriloquism. Between them ghosts can speak. But what if ghosts don’t want to
speak directly? What if ghosts refuse the demarcation and prefers to haunt the
whole text? That is what ghosts usually do, isn’t it? They defy representation
and appearance. Quotation marks were introduced into Arabic writing during the
so-called Arabic Nahda (Awakening or Enlightenment) of the late 19th
century. And when the marks were introduced they were called “Tadbib” marks.
The term comes from the study of Hadith (transmitting of the prophetic
tradition), and it actually means something else than the traditional meaning
of quoting. It means that what was marked is not fixed or completed, rather it
is unstable and still needs to be checked and accordingly changed. When animals
started speaking in Kalila wa Dimna and later there were no clear marks of the
speaking voice, quotation marks, which led to an enigmatic reading experience,
because sometimes the reader is not sure who is speaking at a given time. And
this confusion of references has aesthetic as well as political consequences.
Through collective readings of selected texts we can think about the different
modes of citability and the inevitable presence of ghostly voices.","Human Rights","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/current/hrp.html"

system since the advent of agriculture and urbanization 10,000 years ago. This
course explores how natural and human systems are connected, and how global
problems such as climate change, biodiversity loss, species extinction are
linked with one another and with social problems such as financial instability,
widening economic inequality, food insecurity, intensifying conflict, and
public health. We review the empirical evidence of these “wicked problems”, and
introduce core concepts and methodologies from natural, and social sciences
perspectives, together with practical skills that are required to tackle these
issues. We will contemplate alternative political and socioeconomic options
(from indigenous knowledge to shared socioeconomic pathways) and will explore
how impacts of these decisions on future natural and human systems can be assessed
(foresight work). Issues will be considered at a variety of scales—from the
level of individual responsibility to the local, regional, national, and global
dimensions. The course includes a community service component, labs, and guest
lectures.  It will be co-taught by
instructors in the natural and social sciences.","Environmental and Urban Studies","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/current/envstudies.html"

for global progress, ranging from food security to women’s empowerment to
climate change action. One way to achieve these goals is through social
enterprise: creating for-profit and non-profit organizations whose mission is
to advance one or more of the SDGs. This collaborative, cross-institution
course explores the global drivers of change that led to the UN SDG’s, with a
particular focus on Social Enterprise solutions. Bard students will work with
and learn from classes in Colombia, Kyrgyzstan, Palestine and other countries
through a mixture of synchronous on-line, weekly global class, combined with
in-person, project-based learning. The synchronous portion of the course
provides a critical introduction to the SDGs, and the forces behind global
change, ranging from climate to technology to income inequality. The
experiential component on the course involves the students conducting shared
research projects on local enterprise solutions to the SDG’s. Student teams
will choose a sector of interest—energy, food, affordable housing, immigration,
toxic exposure—and map the Hudson Valley ecosystem of for-profit and non-profit
enterprises seeking to address these challenges. The projects will include deep
dives into the strategies pursued by select enterprises within their sector.
The students will produce a final report for distribution to the social
enterprises within their sector. This will be an OSUN Network Collaborative
Course, hybrid in structure, with one global synchronous online session per
week, and one in-person session each week at Bard. The synchronous on-line
session will be taught by Bard MBA Professor Hunter Lovins, meeting one day per
week, simultaneously in all schools online for 90 minutes. The course will have
an in-person, 90-minute section once per week taught by co-instructors to the
practicum work. This is an OSUN Online Class, taught online and open to Bard
students and students from OSUN partner institutions. This is an OSUN Network Collaborative Course, taught on
multiple OSUN partner institutions and designed to allow students to
learn and work together across campuses.","Environmental and Urban Studies","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/current/envstudies.html"

impacts on crop production and land use change. We review crop simulation
models, their applications and limitations, as well as expectations for the
influence of elevated CO2 on crop yield and nutrition. We then turn to a
discussion of the role that agriculture can play in climate change mitigation,
given the large greenhouse gas emissions associated with farming systems. This
takes us to an in-depth discussion of soil carbon management, nitrogen
fertilizer, and trade-offs between emissions from various reduction strategies.
Finally, we will investigate the strategies being put forth regarding climate
change adaptation, including the role of traditional seeds and genetically
modified crops, agroforestry, and system resilience, with major implications
for future food production.","Environmental and Urban Studies","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/current/envstudies.html"

so in the past, and how might these visions be useful in our present? This course
will examine how Black American and Black diasporic communities use and have
used science fiction, fantasy, cosmology, and mythology as arenas in which to
conjure long-lost pasts, alternate realities, and worlds still to come.
Afrofuturism, otherwise known as the Black speculative arts movement, generally
explores intersections between race, technology, and science; our explorations
will extend and interrogate the movement’s more familiar realms to address
questions regarding class, gender expression, sexuality, ability/disability,
citizenship, and the built environment not merely as conjectures for an
imagined futurity, but as reflections of a more recent—and relevant—past and
present. As befits a course that addresses students of literature as well as
the interdiscipline of American studies, our focus will be multidisciplinary,
and we will respect the Afrofuturist canon as much as we depart from—and
perhaps make additions to—it. Texts will include novels, essays, films, music,
visual art, and arts criticism; authors and artists may include: Octavia
Butler, George Clinton, Samuel Delany, Arthur Jafa, Kiese Laymon, Wangechi
Mutu, Audre Lorde, Sun Ra, Ishmael Reed, Tracy K. Smith, Greg Tate, and others.
Though there are no prerequisites, some familiarity with the African American
literary and cultural canon is preferable. This class is jointly offered with
CCS and is open to CCS students as well as Bard undergraduates. Cross-listed:

we are now in the age of the Anthropocene. This recently proposed geologic
period refers to the ways in which human activities have dramatically impacted
and altered every ecosystem on Earth. Now in an age of mass extinction, what
does it mean to visually interpret our more-than-human world and explore the
often messy and complicated encounters between human and nonhuman animals?
Indigenous and traditional ecological knowledge will ground our exploration as
we consider the cultural, artistic, and technological implications of species
decline. Our focus will include examining animal representations from caves to
cages and from the living to the virtual, as well as themes of the wild and the
tame, zoos, laboratory research, and companion species. Each of these topics
will be paired with an exploration of the ever-increasing presence of animals
in contemporary art with particular emphasis on multimedia and inter-species
installations, bio art, as well as experimental video, film, and performance.
Students will work intensively to develop experimental humanities approaches
that blur boundaries between physical and digital media, integrate field-based
research in the Hudson Valley, and experiment with interdisciplinary practices
of art making in order to grapple with ways in which our understanding of other
species directly relates to human self-understanding. This

What is conquest, and how does it permeate Western legal thought from the
Crusades to the massacre of the Attica revolutionaries to the present? How is
conquest manifested spatially through prisons and policing? What is the
relationship between the struggle to free ‘political prisoners’ and the
struggle to abolish a carceral state that Che Gossett contends holds Black and

voluntary sector by politicians and scholars over the past three decades. It
has come to be praised on all sides, however, it has not been understood as
much as it has been admired. We will investigate the theory underpinning civil
society, with its origins in the Scottish Enlightenment and the US
Constitution, then trace these threads through the rise of the not-for-profit
sector and focus on the principles of best practice for organizations
generating significant social impact. 
The end of the Cold War and the collapse of most socialist states
sparked international enthusiasm in the 1990s for the building of civil society
by means of voluntary non-profit activity, in the belief that strong civil
societies would promote democracy. No one has advanced this principle more
aggressively over the past thirty years than billionaire philanthropist George
Soros and his Open Society Foundations, whose work is based on the philosophy
of Karl Popper. The renewal of civil society in Central and Eastern Europe was
met with enthusiasm in the 1990s, yet over the last decade has been met with
resistance and even hostility by political leadership pivoting toward illiberal
democracy and authoritarianism. We will explore the core elements of civil
society and issues such as: Is the movement toward an open society inevitable
and linear? What are the fundamental threats to an open society?","BGIA Courses (NYC)","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/current/bgia.html"

We further explore the interplay of the global ascendance of finance capitalism

to explain how and why socioeconomic inequality is produced and maintained, and
how it affects the well-being of individuals and social groups. The course will
focus on two general themes. The first deals with the structure of inequality
while studying the unequal distribution of material and social resources (e.g.,
social status, earnings, wealth, power). The second examines the processes that
determine the allocation of people to positions in the stratification system

and in all societies, there seem to be individuals who violate these norms and experience
sanctions for doing so. A sanction may be a reward or punishment for one
behaving in such a way. However, not all violations of norms are sanctioned.
The sociological study of deviance examines how certain people and behaviors
come to be defined and labeled as deviant in certain contexts. The course
addresses four critical questions: Who or what defines and decides what norms
must be upheld and what is deviant? How do those responsible for identifying
and sanctioning deviant behavior understand or explain the sources and causes
of deviance? What are the consequences for deviants of being so identified and
treated? And lastly, how is deviant behavior socially controlled informally
(e.g. by the family, peers, or fashion) and through formal organizations (e.g.
by the state, law, schools, and police)? Students will learn to critically
analyze the problems of definition, identification, explanation, and social
reactions to violations of institutional expectations. Throughout the course,
we will discuss how issues of class, race, gender, and cultural and historical
contexts relate to deviance to understand how standards of normality and
deviance always involve relations of power and unequal opportunities to partake
in the rewards of living up to the standards of social respectability. Topics
include: mental illness and mental disabilities; addiction; non-conforming
sexualities; cults; anti-establishment subcultures; youth and delinquency;
crime and policing; and public debates about controversial topics, such as sex
work, abortion, and gun control.","Sociology","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/current/sociology.html"

shall see, we often theorize and apply existing social theories in our everyday
lives. Simply put, a theory is a way of understanding: making sense of all
kinds of social phenomena, from globalization to intimate interpersonal
relationships. In this course, we survey a range of social theories: those
which are foundational to the creation of sociology and all social sciences;
those which focus on the rise and transformations of modern society in the
19th and 20th centuries; and those which
are responses, critiques, or further developments of these other theories. Our
exploration will follow a chronological order of western thought. But
analytically, we will straddle between historical periods (and the equivalent
classifications of “classical” and “contemporary” sociological theory) to
emphasize the ongoing dialogue among different theoretical traditions and
attempts to provide alternative and more nuanced explanations of an
increasingly more diverse social world beyond a
Eurocentric perspective. First, briefly, we trace the ideas that paved the way
to the emergence of the social sciences from the European Enlightenment, which
grappled with notions about the nature of political authority vis à vis the
nature of humanity. We will closely read excerpts of Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau,
Adam Smith, and Kant. Second, we delve into the theoretical accounts of a
period often referred to as Modernity. We will engage with the ideas of
sociology’s “founding fathers” (Durkheim, Marx, Weber, and Simmel) and
America’s “first” sociologists (e.g., Jane Adams, Du Bois, Mead, Park, Perkins
Gilman, and Veblen). Once in the 20th century, we will explore the
theoretical frameworks developed by sociologists and other social scientists to
understand the realities of our recent past up until the present. Then, we will
consider sociological traditions such as functionalism, critical
theory, symbolic interactionism, poststructuralism, postcolonial and feminist
theory, as we read various contemporary authors (e.g. Parsons, Habermas,
Goffman, Bourdieu, Hall, Foucault, Spivak, Said, Latour, and Mohanty).","Sociology","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/current/sociology.html"

punishment and criminal justice. The amount and type of punishment found in
society is not a simple, direct result of crime patterns. Rather, to understand
how and why we punish, we must examine the ways that historical processes,
social structures, institutions, and culture shape penal practices as well as
how systems of punishment shape society. This course draws on sociological and
historical scholarship to explore the social functions of punishment, its
cultural foundations and meanings, what drives changes in how we punish and
police, the relationship between penal practices and state power, and the role
of the system in reproducing race, gender, and class inequality. The course
digs deeply into research on the punitive turn in American criminal justice

different contexts. It features in a range of discourses, such as familial, academic,
political, religious, corporative, medical, and commercial, to name a few.
Often, it addresses various kinds of needs (e.g. health) and concerns (e.g. the
environment). Linguists call words such as “care” polysemous because they have
several meanings. In this two-credit course, we will explore the multiple uses
and meanings that “care” has in a variety of social contexts, practices and
sites in which we come to participate and interact. Our task is two-fold:
First, through our weekly readings and discussions, we try to understand what
the concept means and the “work” it does in each specific context we analyze;
for example, in philosophy, medical practice, disability studies, self-help
books, political debates (e.g. welfare to the poor), the activism and
organizing of social movements (e.g. #BlackLivesMatter), “self-care” guides in
social media, advertisements of agencies that provide care services for the
elderly, and Human Resources materials from places of work, among others.
Second, while we critically engage with these materials to assess how care
“travels” through these different contexts and what it accomplishes, students
will search for other texts, practices, types of paid or unpaid work, symbols,
situations or sites where something that could be called “care” might be
happening but without explicitly mentioning the word. By the end of the
semester, together as a class, we will “curate” and compile a catalogue of
“care” examples, or as sociologists say, of possible “operationalizations” of the
concept. Individually, each student will write a final analytical paper about a
particular use and meaning of “care” that traces how the concept “works”: What
does it accomplish and for whom? What kinds of relationships does it allow or
preclude? How does it provide for or burden the needs or concerns it is
supposed to alleviate? How is it distributed, accessed, or acquired?","Sociology","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/current/sociology.html"

power on an individual and create obligations and duties for an individual. It

our collective quest for equality and freedom. Students will read, discuss, and
write about texts by ancient, modern, and contemporary political thinkers who
developed theories of authority, equality, and freedom, including Plato, Thomas
Hobbes, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche, W. E. B. Du

how authority operates within political societies and what must be done to
legitimately overcome authority whenever it becomes a threat to equality and
freedom. In so doing, we will examine the meaning of such values and ideas as
progress, property, morality, rights, liberty, truth, justice, and domination
while also considering how these values and ideas have shaped—and continue to
shape—political life and society. Throughout the semester we will use the
assigned texts as resources for learning about authority, equality, and

and how we might employ them to analyze present and historical social and
political conditions (including absolutism, democracy, imperialism, capitalism,
sexism, and racism). As such, this class will enhance students’ argumentative
skills and provide them with tools for thinking critically about the world they
inhabit through the study of complex social and political problems and texts.
What cultural, social, economic, and political forces motivate and maintain
relations of power? How do they condition or undermine efforts to create a more

war are inextricable features of the system, and leads to a narrow
understanding of power as simple coercion. The resulting picture of
international political life is bleak, with states resigned to reproducing
patterns of conflict, war, and exploitation. This course—through a critical
examination of International Relations’ foundational concepts of anarchy,
violence and power—interrogates this rendering of international politics
whichnd in doing so provides an introduction to competing theories about the

social, and economic theory during the rise and development of capitalism, from
the late seventeenth century to the present. Throughout its history, capitalism
has been continuously justified, critiqued, and redefined by way of such key
political, social, and economic ideas as liberty, equality, property,
authority, and progress. Likewise, these ideas have been fundamentally shaped
by historical transformations in economic life bound up with the development of
modern capitalist societies, from agrarian capitalism and the Industrial
Revolution to colonial slavery and the high-tech economy. Our approach will be
to place primary texts in modern political, social, and economic thought within
the socioeconomic contexts in which they were originally written and read,
paying particular attention to how thinkers have responded to pivotal events,
innovations, crises, and policies that marked the capitalist societies in which
they lived. Each week will focus on a specific moment of convergence between
theory and history. In the first two weeks, we will read classic works on the
history of capitalism by social and political theorists in order to gain
conceptual clarity on what capitalism is as well as when and how it began. In
subsequent weeks we will read founding works of early-modern political economy
against the backdrop of England’s monetary and agrarian crises in the late
seventeenth century; explore Enlightenment debates about commercial society
through the lens of global commerce and colonial slavery in the eighteenth
century; probe the connections between liberal political thought, imperialism,
and industrial capitalism in the nineteenth century; examine the rise of social
theory in the context of industrialization and mass society from the late 1800s
to the 1950s; and analyze the ways in which neoclassical political economy and
critical theory emerged and transformed in response to the rise of
neoliberalism and the global high-tech economy from the latter half of the
twentieth century to the present. Through readings, lectures, in-class
discussions, and writing assignments, students will acquire an in-depth
understanding of central concepts and problems in modern political, social, and
economic theory and develop the necessary skills to analyze, discuss, and write
about such concepts and problems within a long-range socioeconomic historical
context.","Politics","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/current/politicalstudies.html"

liberation grounded on “return” and “revitalization” of traditional socio-political

beyond the state form, colonial or otherwise, indigenous resurgence also places
distinct importance on feminist liberation in its various forms. In the first half
of the course, we will examine resurgent political imaginaries and visions,
focusing on the practices, writings, art forms, and activism of indigenous
communities and feminist thinkers. We will explore conceptual, theoretical and

of feminist decolonization that is currently being practiced in Rojava, or

The goal of this liberation struggle is to generate anti-statist,

fractured by nation-states and the increasingly more racialized manifestations
of the latter. By putting indigenous resurgence theory developed largely in

logic, an argument aims to prove that its conclusion is true; from the

conclusion.  Often, these two aims
diverge.  Some arguments are logically
powerful yet fail to persuade, while others are highly convincing but logically
anemic.  The fault lies not in language but

relation called implication. (The course concentrates on deductive implication,

Ward, Hortense Spillers, Zakiyyah Iman Jackson,
Patrice Douglas, The Nap Ministry, Calvin Warren, Tiffany Lethabo-King,

given names or refuse to participate in the economy, we’ll ponder the
feasibility, possibility, sustainability and worthwhileness of Black people's
incorporation into Western nation-states, non-black majority workplaces, “safe”

distinction between refusal and renouncement, and the paradox presented by a
philosophy of Black refusal; a phrase whose modifier reifies Western systems of

and with it the identity of its citizens – has been haunted since inception by
its heterogeneous past.  Topics of

cultural background, and geopolitical desires? Starting with Gorbachev’
Perestroika, which amalgamated paradigms of Soviet foreign relations with an
attempt to resolve internal issues, we will move on to investigating the two
major upheavals: the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the crash of the Yalta-Potsdam
system. These historical milestones will help us frame the Russian foreign
affairs of the early 1990s as a continuation of the Soviet foreign policy, with
its focus on cooperation with the West. Our next subject will be such turning
points of post-Soviet foreign policy transformation as the Primakov Loop over
the Atlantic (1999) and Putin’ Munich Speech (2007). Making a quick detour to
the history of Soviet national politics, we will then proceed to map Russia’s
historical path to the current war with Ukraine. Each class will include a
study of primary historical documents. Course readings will incorporate the
theoretical works on “Soft Power” by Joseph S. Nye, Jr., Yasushi Watanabe, and
David L. McConnell; essays on foreign diplomacy by Henry Kissinger, Hans
Morgenthau, and Iver B. Neumann; and the concepts of Geopolitics and Heartland,
popular among Putin’s associates, in the works of Halford John Mackinder and

ancient Classical ideas. The Renaissance was in part the result of a flow of
ideas coming out of the Islamic world where ancient natural philosophy had been
integrated with monotheistic religion. The Book of Nature became a viable path
for understanding and celebrating God. This integration was not without
controversy, but its influence on European savants is undeniable. Descartes,
Vesalius, Copernicus, Galileo, and Newton are not so much revolutionaries of a
Scientific Revolution as they are part of a continuous flow of ideas with a
source in the Islamic world of the Middle Ages, the Golden Age of Islam. This
course emphasizes the continuity of natural philosophical thought from the
Classical Era to the Renaissance and places these ideas in a larger historical
context. The class will be divided into two unequal parts. The shorter first
part will focus on the Crusades and religion. The remainder of the class will

human physiology, and cognition. Readings from primary source authors will

Kong’s and Shanghai’s recent economic, social, and cultural dynamism, and in
doing so probes the historical roots of globalization. It analyzes how
nineteenth- and early twentieth-century colonialism and semi-colonialism both
drove and conditioned, in somewhat different ways, the development of these two
cities. It also asks how this earlier phase of integration into global networks
of commerce and culture relates to the patterns of the last fifty years.

Wars of Religion and several financial bubbles burst. It looks at the social
groups most associated with spreading hearsay, women, “the common people,” and
the enslaved, and at those groups, identified usually by religious difference,
who were made scapegoats to the majority populations in crisis periods. As a
study of what passed for information and its changing media, students sample
different methods of socio-cultural analysis to chart its transmission and
reception. The entangled histories of rumor, heresy, disease, and financial
panic suggest themselves as precursors of mass media propaganda, agitprop, and
fake-news. But they also indicate a world in which the body, bodiliness, and
body metaphors were central to truth claims, whether folk wisdom, common sense,
or princely decree. These phenomena are intimately tied to state-building, the
rise of the police, and administrative centralization. The course looks
squarely at cyclical histories of hatred, of strangers, religious minorities,
and racial others, with the understanding that contemporaries did not view
their beliefs as such, but rather as simple or prophetic truth. Time,
information, knowledge, and communication, at play together, are the critical
ingredients to historiographical understanding. Students will answer the

attitudes towards the consumption of hashish from the Mamluk (13th

law is equivocal on the permissibility of consuming cannabis, and, in Mamluk
society, such consumption was commonplace, even if the public display of
cannabis was not. In the aftermath of the colonial encounter in the late
nineteenth century, however, the consumption of hashish came to symbolize the
illnesses of the “Orient”. It was construed as the cause of laziness and
weakness that caused the backwardness of the “Orient”. Through examining legal
manuals, chronicles, medical reports, court records, police documents, court
record, travelers’ accounts, poetry, movies, and novels, in addition to
secondary literature, we will analyze this shift in the attitude towards the
consumption of cannabis, as well as the subsequent shifts that contributed to
the rise of postcolonial states, demarcated national identities, and modern

measurement of social welfare, consumer behavior, individual and market demand,
choice under uncertainty, production and cost, profit maximization, market
structures (perfect competition, monopoly, duopoly, monopsony, monopolistic
competition, and oligopoly), market failures, strategic behavior, price
discrimination, the economics of information, the provision of public goods,
the use of game theory to model economic behavior, and the market effects of
taxes and other government policies. Students work through a series of problem
sets as they learn to manipulate and apply microeconomic models. A final paper

who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made.”
Today, the COVID-19 crisis and mass unemployment have once again exposed the
pervasive pathologies in the economy, such as inequality, poverty, and
discrimination that reproduce systemic racial, gender and environmental
injustice. Roosevelt responded to the economic calamity of his time—the Great
Depression—with far-reaching economic policies and an appeal for what he called
a Second (Economic) Bill of Rights that led with the right to decent and
remunerative employment. “Jobs for All” was a signature demand during the Civil
Rights era, when Martin Luther King, Jr. and Coretta Scott King insisted that
unemployment is a key force for racial subjugation. Today, the Job Guarantee
has been called perhaps the most crucial component of the Green New Deal
Resolution, a program that ensures a just transition for all workers and an
antidote to systemic racial and gender discrimination that emerges from labor
markets.  This interdisciplinary course
traces the history of the struggle to secure the right to employment for  all. It will focus on the economic, legal,
and policy developments in the United States, and will introduce students to
some international policy initiatives and innovative programs. A key question
for discussion is whether these proposals and concrete policies have advanced
the goal of equity and economic justice. Students will read legislative
documents, economic analyses, policy proposals, and program reviews.  This course is part of the Racial Justice
Initiative, an interdisciplinary collaboration among students and faculty to
further the understanding of racial inequality and injustice in the United
States and beyond. This is an OSUN Network

the causes of internal conflict, paying particular attention to the debate on
whether it is grievance or opportunity that predicts the onset of collective
violence. This leads naturally to an investigation of the essentially
intertwined role of economic inequality, ethnic fragmentation, and natural
resource endowments on the occurrence of conflict. We then move on to an
exploration of the lasting consequences of conflict, emphasizing the fact that
war is essentially a gendered phenomenon. We end the course by looking at

and is now the highest on record. Since 2000, 95% of income gains have gone to
the top 1% whose share remains at an all-time high, even during economic
downturns. Economists have only recently acknowledged and turned their
attention to these facts. There is still much uncertainty regarding the causes
and consequences of such disturbing trends, let alone the potential economic
policies required to combat inequality and restore social justice. This course
presents a survey of the landmark theories of economic growth and income
distribution focusing on their interconnectedness. Students are invited to
explore the causes and consequences of economic inequality from a variety of
analytical perspectives, to judge the current social division based on ethical
and moral values, and to discuss concrete actions to bring about positive
change toward a just society. Through what processes is income created and
distributed? Why has growth become so biased toward the very few? Is there such
a thing as a balanced or equitable growth and, if so, what does it require?
What are extractive and predatory governments? Why do policies designed to
address inequality end up exacerbating its already unprecedented levels and leading
to further, more pronounced social class division and concentration of power?
In answering these questions, we focus on the case of the United States, one of
the most unequal economies in the world, and complement our analysis with
international comparisons. This is an

embodiment of a mythical, primordial wilderness. Within this evocative imagery,
nature is racialized, and Africans are constructed as existing in a state
closer to nature. Conrad’s Heart of Darkness perhaps best exemplifies this
process, through its exploration of the `savage¿ dimensions of colonialism in
the African interior. Imperial discourses often relied on these tropes of
savagery and barbarism to link understandings of natural history with ideas
about racial difference. Similarly, by blurring the boundary between the human
and the nonhuman, colonial policies created a zone of anxiety around racialized
domestic relationships, particularly in the context of employers and their
servants. Many of these representations were contradictory, as evidenced by Rousseau¿s
image of the noble savage: indigenous people who lived as gentle custodians of
the environment, while at the same time preying upon the resources desired for
exclusive colonial use. After investigating the racialization of nature under
imperial regimes, we will consider the continuing legacies in post-colonial
situations. How have certain ethnic identities, for example, been linked to
nature? How do these associations reproduce social hierarchies and
inequalities? In what ways is race invoked in struggles for land and resource
rights? Through an exploration of ethnographic accounts, historical analyses,

locating it within the historical and global processes of colonialism. By
drawing out the scope of the issue and its interconnections, we hope to
understand better the local and international solidarities required to address
it. Indeed, Black liberationist leaders from W.E.B. Dubois to Stokeley Carmichael, Malcolm X, James Baldwin, Martin
Luther King, and Angela Davis have articulated the demand for racial justice
against a global canvas, and in ways that underlined its continuity with the
anti-colonial movements of their day. They saw a fundamental continuity between
militarism and racialized carceral practice abroad
and at home, and were inspired by Afro-Asian decolonization and the vision of a
decolonized world order articulated by the Bandung Conference. In recent months
the apparatus of global counterinsurgency and the paramilitary arm of border
patrol have been mobilized against protesters on the streets of Washington DC
and Portland. There has long been a reciprocal, mutually constitutive
relationship between regimes of territorial expansion, slaveholding, and the
elimination of indigenous peoples on the North American continent and overseas.
Taking an anthropological approach, and suspending the dichotomy between
foreign and domestic belied by an ever-expanding frontier, the course will
examine the protracted, structuring effects of racialised
practices of warfare, colonial administration, and exploitation on the US
Mainland and in its overseas colonies, territories, protectorates, and bases in
the Pacific, East Asia, and the Caribbean. We will study empire not only as a
historical and now global imperative of hegemony but as a set of formations
structuring the experience and lifeworlds of its
subjects through practices and technologies of social control such as policing,
schools, prisons, camps, reservations and border control. We will also examine
the persistence and recurrence of notions of Western supremacy and
exceptionalism in multiple contexts as we seek postcolonial ethnographic
perspectives on racial injustice.","Anthropology","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/current/anthropology.html"

methodological tools that we use when we practice ethnography? Ethnography is
the cornerstone of contemporary cultural anthropology, and includes both
fieldwork and representation. This course is a survey of, and practicum in,
ethnographic field methods. We will study and critique traditional ethnographic
methods such as participant-observation, interviewing, archival research,
visual, sonic, textual and spatial analysis, and address the challenges of doing
fieldwork in a variety of contexts, including the virtual domain. A series of
sequenced intensive research exercises will raise guiding questions about how
ethnographic research can be ethically and effectively “translated” into
written text. We attend also to emergent ethnographic forms and methods, such
as multi-sited ethnography, critical moral anthropology, and indigenous
methodologies and critiques. To complement the fieldwork projects, we will also
read exemplary, and sometimes controversial, texts of ethnography in practice.
Students will develop a community- or environmentally-based ethnographic
research project of their own design throughout the course of the semester.
Ethical aspects of conducting ethnographic fieldwork, including preparing for
Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, will be addressed. This course

since the discipline’s inception. From Lewis Henry Morgan’s portrait of the
American beaver, to E. E. Evans-Pritchard’s account of the cattle beloved in
Nuer society, animals have always been an essential part of how we see
ourselves and make sense of the world around us. In this course, we trace
anthropology’s engagement over the past century with the figure of the animal.
We begin by exploring some of the discipline’s classic texts in relation to
animals, focusing on their role as repositories of totemic power, markers of
purity and pollution, and mirrors of social identity. We will then consider
questions such as: how, and by whom, is the line between human and animal
drawn? What are the politics of definition and classification? Where are
animals positioned on the moral landscapes of cultures? To address such
questions, we will look closely at animal-based practices such as hunting,
aquaculture, falconry, and petkeeping in cross-cultural context. The final
section of the course focuses on multispecies ethnography, a recent and growing
field that strives to rethink categories of human and nonhuman.","Anthropology","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/current/anthropology.html"

us? In this course, designed for non-majors, we will be reading fictional
fables, in the style of mystery cases, that will explore common logical
fallacies and deceptive statistics. Students will run simulations to
computationally examine each misconception/fallacy and to get a general
understanding of the necessary logic, probability, and decision theory needed
to examine the underlying principles of each story. Students will learn about
common logical fallacies, learn computational methods for understanding these
fallacies, and be able to explain such misconceptions to their peers. In an age
where we are often presented data in a manner that skews our decision-making
process, it is important to understand when our common sense can fail us and trick
us into making poor decisions. Prerequisites: passing score on Part I of the

millions of species of insects and they carry out essential functions in ecosystems.
From wetlands to agricultural fields, from genetics research to forensic
science, insects and their researchers make substantial contributions to our
world. Understanding insect biology is crucial to addressing some of the
biggest scientific challenges of our time, such as climate change, public
health and food security. Insects species remain poorly understood and
documented and face threats such as habitat loss, overuse of pesticides, and
generalized climate change, making stewardship of our insect communities is
increasingly vital. This course will be primarily focused on insect
systematics–the study of evolutionary relationships, classification, and
taxonomy. Students will develop strong skills in insect identification, and
insect diversity will be taught through evolutionary and phylogenetic
frameworks. Over the course of the semester students will curate a museum-grade
insect collection. Course content will also explore topics the role of insects
as parasites, their use in human forensics, and students will acquire field

Tragedy, with a dedication to the composer Richard Wagner, one of the most influential
artists of his time. Nietzsche was attracted to Wagner’s revolutionary ideas
about artistic form and about the role of the arts in social and political
life. Inspired by Wagner and by his study of literature and philosophy,
Nietzsche claims in The Birth of Tragedy that “only as an aesthetic phenomenon
can the world be justified to all eternity.” It is one of the most radical and
controversial assertions ever made about the power of art, and one that
Nietzsche himself would come to re-consider in a biting critique he later wrote
of his own book, as he would also eventually turn against Wagner. Yet even in
this self-critique, Nietzsche maintained that The Birth of Tragedy accomplished
something very important: it began the task of looking “at science from the
perspective of the artist, and art from the perspective of life.” In this
course, we will attempt to grasp what Nietzsche meant by this and to think
through the influence and significance of his writings on art and aesthetics,
both historically over the past 150 years, and for ourselves in the present
moment. We will begin with a deep study of The Birth of Tragedy, which will
incorporate consideration of some key works discussed in that book (these may
include: Sophocles’ Oedipus the King, Euripides’ Bacchae, Raphael’s The

is not your mother tongue? It absolutely is! Prominent examples for this
phenomenon from a global literature written in English include Vladimir
Nabokov, Joseph Conrad, and Nuruddin Farah. Some of the finest literary
writings in German too over the past decades are by authors whose first
language is not German. Migration and exile are the most common but not the
only reasons why an author may begin to work in another language. Their
multilingual practices create a poetically as well as politically fascinating
tension to the so-called “monolingual paradigm” which forms the core of the
powerful concept of “national literature”. 
In this course, we will explore poems, prose, and essays of contemporary
writers who live and work between German and other languages. Among them will
be Japanese-born Yoko Tawada, Turkish-born Emine Oezdamar and Feridun Zaimoglu,
Israeli-born Tomer Gardi, and Ukrainian-born Katja Petrowskaja. Related to
their practice of challenging the monolingual paradigm of traditional
‘Nationalliteratur’ are works by writers who programmatically destabilized
their German by opening it up to other languages – a tradition we will discuss
through writings, e.g., by Franz Kafka, Paul Celan, and Ilse Aichinger.
Critical writings on transnational and multilingual literature, such as Yasemin
Yildiz’ pivotal book “Beyond the Mother Tongue”, will accompany our reflections
on the overarching question of the course: What does it mean from a poetic perspective
to say “I have only one language, and this language is not my own” (Derrida)?

of Animals remained the most authoritative source for knowledge on animal
diversity from the fourth century BC through the eighteenth century AD. It used

The History of Animals was commented upon in Hebrew, Syriac, Arabic,
Latin, and later in vernaculars, such as French or German. Paradoxically, not
only medieval bestiaries with their descriptions of fabled creatures, but also
early modern scientific treatises that laid the ground of today’s zoology were
based on Aristotle. Carl von Linné, the founder of biological nomenclature
currently in use, drew numerous animal names from Aristotle’s text or its Latin
translation. What made the History of Animals so popular for so long? In
this course, designed at an intersection of literature, philosophy, and the
history of natural science, we will begin to answer that question by studying
Aristotle’s accounts of various animals, from insects to mammals, and by
investigating how they were modified, distorted and embellished by ancient,

ways that language, form, genre and convention transform as poets seek
alternatives to their own traditions by reaching back to others, often across
international borders, languages, and centuries. We will study how some modern
poetries take song traditions as their point of departure—for instance, the
relation between Native American song and contemporary Native American
poets—and how others resonate with ancient spiritual poetries—for example, the
influence of the Quran on Mahmoud Darwish. Matters of historical context and
theories of translation will guide us, even as the principal focus will always
be the practice of reading the poetry itself. We will give particular attention
to lyric traditions from the regions represented by the OSUN network. Some of
the contemporary poets we’ll read include: Ama Ata Aidoo (Ghana), Zeyar Lynn

consider work from the Tang dynasty, medieval Japan, Renaissance and Romantic
Europe, and the Latin American 20th century. As an introductory

students at Bard published a newspaper called The Observer. In the paper’s
early years, as it found its footing, it appeared annually; at its peak, The
Observer arrived every month and ran a dozen broadsheet pages long. Consider
some tantalizing headlines from the first issue: “International Weekend Mixed
Success; Many Speakers, Few Foreign Students,” “Open House at Fairbairn,”
“Council hears Student Grievances,” “Nelson Talks on Oysters,” “From the
President: On Bard’s Future,” “Fat Mice and People,” and, not unimportantly,
“The Idea of a Newspaper.” The Observer, as it matured, offered a lively,
substantial and sophisticated range of reporting, criticism, commentary,
fiction and poetry, all showcasing the interplay of voices and ideas and
activities at Bard. Heck, there were even personals: “Odd jobs by the hour:
piano, poker, and bridge playing, rooms cleaned, paper typed, chauffeuring;
also overnite [sic] accommodation.” Like many
American newspapers, when the 21st century arrived, The Observer fell victim to a disastrous die-off, the industry losing
2,200 papers and seeing the number of working journalists cut in half.
70,000,000 Americans were left without a local news source. For the most part,
if people read a newspaper today, they go to one of the flavors of national
paper congruent with their politics, papers in which a diversity of editorial
perspectives rarely coexist. In this 2-credit course meeting one per week,
students will study the history of the newspaper—a form of civic engagement
that depends upon formal decisions for its success, success measured by its
usefulness to its readership. We will take apart examples of newspapers both
large and small, to the end of understanding the newspaper as a literary form:
what a newspaper has been and can be. We will give thought to the ethical,
technological and practical domains of editorial life, as the class hatches a
plan for the future—the future of the Observer. The course is particularly
well-suited to members of the lower college who can imagine wanting to spend
several of their Bard years working on the paper. Participants should know that
there will be a tremendous amount of individual initiative demanded of you,
including autonomous database research, reports on their findings in the

of Rites, one of the Confucian classics, “Music is that which communicates
human relations and natural principles.” Since the dawn of Chinese
civilization, music, or yue 樂, had occupied a central place in people’s
intellectual inquiry and cultural imaginary. Music is multi- and trans-
disciplinary that encompasses different areas of human knowledge. To premodern
Chinese thinkers, its implications reach to the cosmological and scientific
(how to calculate notes and harmonic), philosophical (how to perceive music in mind
and represent it in writings), moral (how to use music to regulate human
behaviors), political (how to represent a state’s cultural legitimacy in court
ritual music), materialistic (how to select materials to make musical
instruments) and, since the beginning of the last century, nationalistic (how
to define a Chinese musical tradition). Music has become the metaphor and
symbol whereby people envision the universe, society, and self. This course
introduces students to the rich tradition of musical philosophy, art, and
performance from the first millennium BCE to the early 20th century
and unpacks the complexity of the concepts of yue
in different historical moments. Through reading primary and secondary
scholarship, we will focus on premodern literati’s debates over music and its
philosophical connotations, the emergence of new institutions that changed the
forms of music, and music’s connections to other artistic forms, such as poetry

century, Russian scholar Mikhail Bakhtin, who greatly contributed to the
contemporary discourse on literary theory, linguistic anthropology, and the
philosophical and political issues, developed powerful ideas addressing these
questions. His major concepts, which are deeply interconnected, include
“dialogism,” “polyphony,” and “carnival.” In this course we will seek to engage
in dialogue with Bakhtin and to probe his ideas within the cultural context of
today. In particular, we will focus on carnivalesque narrative in artistic
forms of representation. By drawing on examples from Russian literature, we

from the prevailing truth of the established order; [how] it marks the
suspension of all hierarchical rank, privileges, norms and prohibitions.” The

Tolstoy composed magnificent works of short fiction. Often highly
autobiographical, Tolstoy draws in these short works on his experiences from
childhood on, opening up for exploration virtually every issue that haunted
him—and Russia--during his long, tumultuous life (1828-1910). The position of
women with respect to marriage, sex and the family; the quest for religious
faith; the existential phenomenon of death; the problems of autocracy,
aristocracy and serfdom; questions of education; Russia’s political turmoil;
and the realities of military life are only a few of the subjects he tackles

in large part by secularism. The declining rates of participation in organized religion
in Western Europe and North America over the past century have been seen by
many as evidence of the natural and inevitable disappearance of religious faith

monolithic secularism of twentieth- and twenty-first century western thought,
there exists an important counter-tradition of writers and thinkers who have
complicated this narrative, engaging with religious issues in thought-provoking
and often heterodox ways. Though well known and respected as intellectuals,
these authors have tended not to be studied in secular academic institutions
or, if they are studied, not to be considered in the context of other religious
thinkers. In this class, we will be reading these authors, in this context.

Good Person of Szechwan, Three Penny Opera, The Measures Taken) and by Tankred
Dorst (D’Annunzio: The Forbidden Garden; Merlin: This Beautiful Place), the
latter being the one of the most significant post-war German playwrights albeit
hardly known in the U.S. (4) ‘Migration and Transformation’ addresses
conditions of our current world – in politics and the arts, where projects such
as Rimini-Protokoll deliberately cross the lines between theater, performance,
reportage, and political activism. Questions around gender and sexuality inform
most of these plays and will be a recurring theme in our discussions. Alongside
the plays, we will engage with selected poetic writings by those authors as
well as with related theories (of imagination, of performance, of gender etc.).

American.” The term was the modest contribution of a community of Asian
students in California’s Bay Area who had been inspired by the self-fashioning
initiative of the civil rights and Black Power movements of the 1950s and
1960s. Ignoring the arbitrariness and historical divisions implicit in the term
“Asian”—and defiantly rejecting longstanding terms of derision such as
“Oriental” or “Asiatic”—these students conceived of the Asian American as a new
(and newly empowered) citizen, and the moment itself represented a turning
point in the history of Asians living in the United States. The decades since
have brought confusion—albeit a productive kind of confusion. Nowhere have the
parameters of Asian American identity been contested more thoroughly than in
discussions of literature. During this semester-long course, we will conduct a
survey of the literary works produced by Asians in the United States, from
poetry carved on the walls of immigration detention centers and travel
reportage to experimental fiction, film, graphic novels, zines and memoir.
Throughout this course, we will also pay close attention to how different
generations of Asian Americans have negotiated their own racialization, the
slippery qualities of this category of identification—even those who wrote
before the category existed. We will pursue twin narratives: one which accepts
these texts as acts of imagination and aspiration, experience and
experimentation; and the other tracing the subtler lines of criticism and
self-revision implicit to a body of literature encircled by such fraught
boundaries. This course is part of the Rethinking Place: Bard-on-Mahicantuck Initiative.","100 and 200 Level Classes","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/current/lit2courses.html"

various forms of Arab cultural production in the Americas. As a class, we will
trace the experience of early twentieth-century Arab immigrants to the Americas
and examine their attempts at cultural translation as they wrestle with
feelings of longing and belonging. We will also read texts that address the
uneasy relationship between Arab-American identity and the United States’
imperial ambitions and practices, ranging from one of political dissonance to
one of confidence in the emulsifying power of the melting pot metaphor. Between
these two positions, the hyphenated identity is stretched to its limits, and
the affective bonds of belonging begin to unravel. In the twenty-first century,
after 9/11, the invasion of Iraq, and the United State’s desire for “a new
middle east,” the hyphen risks to become an insurmountable, unbridgeable, and
divisive fault line, yet Arab-Americans will continue to write histories of the
present through their creative work and challenge the hateful discourse of the
war on terror. Finally, we consider the prospects that Arab American authors
envision for the future through contemporary speculative fiction. Our authors

for the Experimental Humanities concentration. Modernity is often described in
terms of the development of science’s experimental method and in terms of the
proliferation of populations living in urban environments. What does
experimentation have to do with how communities and publics organize their
lives in cities? How have certain populations been disempowered and
marginalized, and how have other aspects of civic life, such as politics,
infrastructure, the environment, cultural production, and public health been
impacted by the relationship between science and technology and urban life?
This course studies two twinned concepts, “the city” and “the experiment,” from
a variety of different disciplinary perspectives to interrogate the distances between
experimentation and lived experience, theory and practice, and the humanities,
the arts, and the sciences. Collaborative and interdisciplinary in both form
and content, this is an OSUN Network-Collaborative course that will involve
sustained interactions between students at Bard College and students in a
parallel urban sociology course at the European Humanities University in
Lithuania. Culminating in the study of “urban laboratories” as sites of
sociological experimentation, the course will challenge students at Bard and
EHU to collaboratively, imaginatively, and experimentally engage with concrete
civic problems. Readings will stretch from early modernity and the
Enlightenment through urgent contemporary texts, and will situate artistic
works by authors such as Thomas More, Italo Calvino, Octavia Butler, and N. K.
Jemisin alongside theoretical, historical, and critical texts by Francis Bacon,
Augusto Boal, Jane Jacobs, Michel de Certeau, Doreen Massey, and Bruno Latour. This is an OSUN Network Collaborative Course, taught on

many as evidence of the natural and inevitable disappearance of religious faith

there exists an important counter-tradition of writers and thinkers who have

‘Revolution,’ we will investigate through Georg Büchner’s “Woyzeck” and

the 19th century still relevant today. (3) ‘Populism’ and its
totalitarian aspirations have ignited signature works by Bertolt Brecht (The
Good Person of Szechwan, Three Penny Opera, The Measures Taken) and by Tankred
Dorst (D’Annunzio: The Forbidden Garden; Merlin: This Beautiful Place), the
latter being the one of the most significant post-war German playwrights albeit
hardly known in the U.S. (4) ‘Migration and Transformation’ addresses

reportage, and political activism. Questions around gender and sexuality inform
most of these plays and will be a recurring theme in our discussions. Alongside

human relations and natural principles.” Since the dawn of Chinese
civilization, music, or yue 樂, had occupied a central place in people’s intellectual
inquiry and cultural imaginary. Music is multi- and trans- disciplinary that
encompasses different areas of human knowledge. To premodern Chinese thinkers,
its implications reach to the cosmological and scientific (how to calculate
notes and harmonic), philosophical (how to perceive music in mind and represent
it in writings), moral (how to use music to regulate human behaviors),
political (how to represent a state’s cultural legitimacy in court ritual
music), materialistic (how to select materials to make musical instruments)

Chinese musical tradition). Music has become the metaphor and symbol whereby
people envision the universe, society, and self. This course introduces

coordinates on a map feel knowable or intimate. We will survey a range of
novels and short stories, critical theory and journalistic reportage, essays
and manifestos. We will regard influential urban theorists and street skaters
in California alike as our intellectual lodestars. Drawing on these methods and
disparate influences, students will pursue their own, sustained exploration of
the course themes, which might take the form of a research paper, a reported
essay, or anything in-between. Our time together will be guided by a set of
broad, related questions: What do our surroundings want from us? How do these
surroundings—city blocks, buildings, roads, parks—change us? What stories do
our movements through space tell? And finally: what power does an individual
have to reshape or reimagine the vast landscape around them? Authors may
include: Donald Barthelme, Walter Benjamin, Chang-rae Lee, Colson Whitehead,
George Perec, Rebecca Solnit, Teju Cole, Jamaica Kincaid, Jose Vadi. This
course satisfies the American Studies junior seminar requirement.","Literature","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/current/literature.html"

techne-zen, personal computing, and the spirit of global capitalism, among

forms of Arab cultural production in the Americas. As a class, we will trace
the experience of early twentieth-century Arab immigrants to the Americas and
examine their attempts at cultural translation as they wrestle with feelings of
longing and belonging. We will also read texts that address the uneasy
relationship between Arab-American identity and the United States’ imperial
ambitions and practices, ranging from one of political dissonance to one of
confidence in the emulsifying power of the melting pot metaphor. Between these
two positions, the hyphenated identity is stretched to its limits, and the
affective bonds of belonging begin to unravel. In the twenty-first century,
after 9/11, the invasion of Iraq, and the United State’s desire for “a new
middle east,” the hyphen risks to become an insurmountable, unbridgeable, and
divisive fault line, yet Arab-Americans will continue to write histories of the
present through their creative work and challenge the hateful discourse of the
war on terror. Finally, we consider the prospects that Arab American authors
envision for the future through contemporary speculative fiction. Our authors
