centuries represent the “normal” body, as well as a constellation of bodies
presented as extraordinary: bodies that differ from the average at birth or are
transformed by illness or war; bodies paraded as “freaks”; bodies that don’t
fit into established categories. We begin in the early nineteenth century, when
popular Enlightenment ideology suggested Americans could control their own
destinies, making and remaking their characters, and even their bodies, at
will. What ideas emerged here about the kind of self one should make, and the
kinds of bodies that should be discarded? How were those ideas proffered in and
shaped by literary imaginings? How have they persisted and changed over time,
especially in relation to ideas about American identity? Our reading list takes
us into the present day, and includes an introduction to the major questions
and scholarly perspectives under debate at the intersection of Disability
Studies and the study of literature. We also work with critical, theoretical,
and historical texts on disability as an intersectional identity requiring
intentional and sustained examination in order to bring into being a more just
and inclusive society. This course is cross-listed with the MAT program for 4+1

an overview of the different ways to approach disability in the field of

the American education system, including a brief history of the disability
rights movement, historical perspectives, advocacy initiatives (such as
Conventions on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD; Disability
Rights, Education, Activism, and Mentoring, DREAM, etc.), and the legal
framework (the access it provides and the limitations it produces). Differences
between the medical model and social model of disability, and
institutionalization and deinstitutionalization will be discussed and examined
in the context of educational settings. Disability, as it relates to education,
will be examined from both a civil rights and human rights perspective. The
course will consider the following questions: What is ableism and how does it
appear in education? What is a disability from historical, legal, and
humanistic perspectives? What does it mean to be disabled in America? What does
access in educational settings for disabled students mean? What are the laws
that contribute to access (ADA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, IDEA,
Fair Housing Act, etc.)? What are educational modifications and “reasonable
accommodations?” Students will learn to think critically about disability in a
variety of contexts and have a greater understanding of the complexities
surrounding disability in education. Students will also develop a deeper
understanding of exclusionary and inclusionary educational practices as well as
inaccessible and accessible educational environments for disabled people.","Bard BA/MAT 4 + 1 Program","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/mat.htm"

Why aren't there more
women in leadership positions? According to a 2018 Pew Research Center report,
the majority of American men and women acknowledge the capacity of women to
lead. Yet in certain domains--most notably politics and business-- continue
to be under-represented at the top and the American public remains
skeptical that gender parity can be achieved.  Recent elections have
galvanized the electorate around constructions of gender in particularly
dramatic ways.  If we are living in a post-feminist society (as some
claim), why do these questions and conflicts continue to arise? Identity is an
urgent conversation in 21st-century politics and everyday life, and this
includes awareness of how intersectionality shapes gendered experiences. What
are the stories that we tell ourselves and each other about equality,
representation, privilege, freedom, authority, and success? How do these
inflect real-world outcomes for individuals and societies?  In this
two-credit course we will explore some of the stories that circulate in our
culture around women and power, both from an academic and from a practical,
real-world perspective. What does it mean to lead? How do we use a language of
empowerment? Why has the United States embraced certain narratives of gender
equity and success as opposed to those being created in other countries and
cultures? We will focus on learning from women who are committed to making a
difference in the world through their personal and professional choices,
hearing their stories, and reading texts that have been particularly important
to them in their lives and work. So too, we will engage with stories from the
past (archival research), from across disciplines (government,
politics, the military, higher education, STEM, the arts, tech, media) and from
a wide range of perspectives.  As an Engaged Liberal Arts and
Sciences course, this seminar will provide students with the unique opportunity
to bring theory and practice together in a very immediate sense: by the end of
the term you will have identified a story only you can tell, whether it is
based in political activism, community engagement, or work experience. Drawing
on the rich resources here in Annandale as well as through Bard's other
campuses we will reach out to groups and organizations with a shared focus on
gender. Network building is something we will explicitly

Before the development of synthetic dyes in the second half of the nineteenth
century, natural dyestuffs were cultivated, traded, and used across the world
not only as highly coveted commodities, but also as sources of scientific
knowledge, inspiration for creativity, and social and cultural identities. At
once the product of local land and long-distance transactions, natural dyes
help us navigate and rethink the boundaries and connections between local and
global, indigenous and foreign, and permanent and transitory. Drawing upon dye
plants currently growing in and around the Bard campus, including indigo,
madder, sumac, goldenrod, safflower, and marigold, we will examine how natural
dyes initiated cultural transformations, scientific developments, and human
interactions with the natural world in their rooted and mobile states. A

inescapable feature of our international political system. While it must be
managed lest it have devastating effects, it remains a vital element of our
collective international system—a political system that many find acceptable
and desirable, despite the death and destruction it can cause. While the past
few years have seen a rise in (inter)national discussions of abolitionist
politics centering on carceral politics, policing, and nuclear weapons, there
has not been a similarly high profile move regarding war abolition. The early
20th century saw the flourishing of anti-war movements whose
activism for peace included efforts to outlaw war entirely, most famously
codified in the 1928 Kellogg-Briand Pact prohibiting war. This class will use
abolitionist politics in other contemporary contexts—e.g. anti-nuclear,
anti-prison, and anti-police movements—as a lens for investigating war
abolition. It will also explore pacifist theory and practice, nonviolence, as
well as critical theoretical approaches toward war and sovereignty. Through
reading about abolitionist politics, pacifism, nonviolence, and theories of

presented as extraordinary: bodies that differ from the average at birth or are
transformed by illness or war; bodies paraded as “freaks”; bodies that don’t
fit into established categories. We begin in the early nineteenth century, when
popular Enlightenment ideology suggested Americans could control their own
destinies, making and remaking their characters, and even their bodies, at
will. What ideas emerged here about the kind of self one should make, and the
kinds of bodies that should be discarded? How were those ideas proffered in and
shaped by literary imaginings? How have they persisted and changed over time,
especially in relation to ideas about American identity? Our reading list takes
us into the present day, and includes an introduction to the major questions
and scholarly perspectives under debate at the intersection of Disability
Studies and the study of literature. We also work with critical, theoretical,

intentional and sustained examination in order to bring into being a more just

the perspective of women’s experiences within this field. We will explore the
role that psychiatry has played in defining and shaping what has been
considered ‘normal female’ as opposed to ‘normal male’ behavior. The course
begins with the history of conceptualizing the ‘female madness’ starting from
the witchcraft persecution in Europe to the emergence of diagnostic categories
such as “neurasthenia’ and ‘hysteria’ which were frequently applied to women in
the 19 th and early 20 th centuries. We will discuss biological explanations
used to explain mental disorder in women and associated psychiatric practices
of the past. The key point of the course is to look at how gender roles and
stereotypes may have contributed to definitions of mental illness with varied
impacts on women and men. For example, we will read materials about how women
who deviated from their ascribed gender roles were continuously likely to be
categorized as ‘insane’. In the second part of the course, our focus will be on
how diagnoses have changed over time and the modern day gender biases still
found in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).
Intersections of gender with race, class and sexual subjectivity in the history
of abnormal psychology will be examined throughout the course. Prerequisites:

votes, canvassing, striving after popularity, desire for advancement,
ostentation, pomp < ambit- , past participial stem of ambīre to go round or
about. From elections to education, ambition (or its absence) has become for
many of us a defining feature of life in the twenty-first century—the quest to
do more, better, faster. Where does ambition come from? How should we think
about it? And what can we do about it? In 2015, Reese Witherspoon declared
“ambition is not a dirty word,” but she is just one of the latest in a long
line of thinkers, writers, poets, and scholars who have considered ambition and
its discontents. This course brings together authors from ancient Greece,
India, Rome, and the more recent world—from Augustine to Spinoza, from the
Buddha to Sophocles—who grappled with the ambiguities and complexities of
ambition. In the classical Indian tradition, Heroic hymns celebrate the impulse
to power, scholastic treatises theorize it in detail, and court poetry adorns
it. When fame no longer serves as goad or goal, ambition and power are subsumed
within a discourse of duty (dharma). In the ancient Greek Iliad, Achilles wants
to be the “best of the Achaeans” and to be celebrated in song. And for the
Romans, ambition was always a delicate balance: act with too little, and one
risked sinking the family name; too much, and you might be labeled a social
parasite, or worse, a sociopathic tyrant. To this equation, the introduction of
Christianity to the Roman world only added complicating factors. Gospel mandates
to strive for perfect holiness changed the game and raised the stakes of
ambition—heaven was now on the line. At the same time, they paradoxically
commanded the most ambitious Christians to be utterly meek. But there is also a
rich tradition of discordant voices that challenge the dominant, ambitious
tone: Buddhist and Jain ascetics standing next to mythic figures from the
epics; ordinary devotees amidst the prophets of the past; Romans, who wrote
obsessively in efforts to resolve the conflicting social pressures of
ambition—to be at once ruthlessly competitive and yet also responsible to
hierarchy and decorum; Aristotle and the quiet virtues of being good enough.
How might this unlikely chorus displace or denature the ego, the seat of
ambition? And how do we envision ethical action in a universe that no longer
revolves around the individual agent? Could one be both a humble
servant—whether to gods, God, or the State—and a superstar?","The Common Courses","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/commoncourses.htm"

reconsider Ukraine’s relationship to the question of what it means to
“decolonize.” This present-day revaluation of Ukraine’s complex imperial
inheritances has centered primarily on Ukraine’s historical relationship to the
Russian Empire (and the Russocentric Soviet Union), often to the exclusion of
Ukraine’s Ottoman, Austro- Hungarian, and other imperial inheritances. This
tragic moment of reflection raises a number of bedeviling questions. How do we
narrate a decolonial history of Ukraine? Is it possible, or desirable, to
disentangle Ukrainian culture from empires of the past and present? Can we
imagine a future political and economic order for Ukraine that is not wholly
dependent upon more powerful global and regional actors? This course juxtaposes
the arguments of influential decolonial theorists against case studies in
Ukrainian history, culture, and political economy. Students will gain exposure
to texts written by African, Indian, South American, Middle Eastern, North
American Indigenous, and Eastern European thinkers on the subject of
decolonization. In parallel, we will study key Ukrainian artistic, political,

canon of classical music, art history, literature, and cinema. We consider
debates about “decommunization,” the racialized dynamics of migration, and what
it means to call oneself Ukrainian after 2022. Students will design and carry

fact, very few revolutions occurred in Latin America in the twentieth century,
but there were many revolutionary movements. This class explores the major
revolutions in twentieth-century Latin America and their results for other
parts of Latin America, including the Mexican Revolution and the Cuban
Revolution. It also examines the more common phenomenon of people’s movements
and revolutionary movements in Latin America that did not participate in
revolutions, especially in the parts of the Caribbean colonized by the Spanish
Empire, including islands and parts of Central and South America. Using primary
sources from the participants in the revolutionary processes and movements and
recently published scholarship on them, the goals of the class are to
understand why revolutions happened when they did, why they often did not
happen, and how revolution as ideology, concept, and process mattered to the
meanings of Latin America in the twentieth century. The two main countries that
this class studies, Mexico and Cuba, were and are ethnically and racially
diverse countries and the class deals with the different meanings and forms of
diversity in their respective modern contexts. The revolutions the class
studies also derived from conflicts over differences in class, geography,
nationality, political affiliation, race, socio-economic background, and,
inequality. This course is part of the Racial Justice Initiative, an
interdisciplinary collaboration among students and faculty to further the
understanding of racial inequality and injustice in the United States and
beyond.","Latin American and Iberian Studies","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/lais.html"

transform culture. We will consider old and new forms alike, from print media
to social media, from the camera obscura to photography, from broadcast
television to early net.art, and from the diorama to virtual reality, as we
explore how media have continually constructed our perceptions of time, space,
knowledge, and identity. We will read media theorists such as Walter Benjamin,
Marshall McLuhan, Jessica Marie Johnson, Donna Haraway, Lev Manovich, Erkki
Huhtamo, and Lisa Nakamura alongside examining the work of artists such as Nam
June Paik, Stephanie Dinkins, Guillermo Goméz-Peña, Wendy Red Star, Ricardo
Dominquez, Mary Flanagan, and Will Wilson. We will also spend hands-on time
working creatively with media, in order to assess our own positions as
producers as well as users and consumers of media. This course fulfills a

system since the advent of agriculture and urbanization 10,000 years ago. This
course explores how natural and human systems are connected, and how global
problems such as climate change, biodiversity loss, species extinction are
linked with one another and with social problems such as financial instability,
widening economic inequality, food insecurity, intensifying conflict, and
public health. We review the empirical evidence of these “wicked problems”, and
introduce core concepts and methodologies from natural, and social sciences
perspectives, together with practical skills that are required to tackle these
issues. We will contemplate alternative political and socioeconomic options
(from indigenous knowledge to shared socioeconomic pathways) and will explore
how impacts of these decisions on future natural and human systems can be assessed
(foresight work). Issues will be considered at a variety of scales—from the
level of individual responsibility to the local, regional, national, and global
dimensions. The course includes a community service component, labs, and guest
lectures.  It will be co-taught by
instructors in the natural and social sciences.","Environmental Studies","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/es.htm"

Participating schools include BRAC University in Bangladesh, Al Quds University
in Palestine, the American Universities of Central Asia (in Kyrgyzstan) and of
Bulgaria, Universidad de Los Andes in Colombia, and Bard. Past certificate
courses have incubated powerful social business ideas in Bangladesh, Palestine and the US.  The course culminates in a “shark tank

The course includes readings and discussion focused on social issues related to
entrepreneurship: drivers of change, from decarbonization to AI; delinking
growth from material throughput; urban-based innovation ecosystems; social
obstacles to risk taking; working on multi-disciplinary teams; language, power

formal instruction in the fundamentals of using spatial information, conducting
spatial analysis, and producing high-quality cartographic products. Students
will learn how GIS may be used as a tool for identifying and assessing
environmental justice (EJ) issues at the local, regional and global scale.
Students will apply these GIS skills and knowledge base to a team-based
research project focused on an environmental justice problem. The course
culminates in a presentation workshop session, where students show their
analysis and results to their peers, professors and the greater Bard
community.  Students complete a
semester-long course project which applies GIS analysis tools and knowledge of
spatial thinking and human geography to analyze a problem, research question,
or policy question related to environmental justice. The project will allow the
students to apply their GIS knowledge to analyze problems discussed in their
other classes, in their community, or areas of interest. Students are encouraged
to focus their work in such a way that allows them to meaningfully and
productively engage with a community impacted by the topic of their project.","Environmental Studies","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/es.htm"

provides a political framework to capture the dynamic and complex relationships
between these and other critical factors 
scientific, economic, cultural, institutional and ethical  that influence how society responds to
environmental problems from the local to international levels. In addition,
this class will help us track and navigate the larger political context that
has provided openings for the modern environmental movement to emerge in the
United States during the 1960s, and the advancement and retrenchment of
environmental law and policies over time, both at the domestic and
international level. The historical context is critical for understanding how
we arrived at the present moment, one with a fraught political sphere and
decades of past policy choices that has structured inequality and led to severe
environmental injustice in many areas of the country.","Environmental Studies","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/es.htm"

to human rights advocacy. The first track (first meetings of the week) focuses on
the history of human rights advocacy. It is anchored in developing a chronology
and typology for making claims to humanity and/or human rights as well as
denouncing their violations, especially on behalf of others. In this sense, we
will explore how, when, and why have individuals and groups spoken out, mounted
campaigns, produced publications, and more all while referring to a common
humanity or notion of human rights. We will also address how such mobilizations
intersect with state power and the institutional organization of the
contemporary international system. To this end, we will explore the campaign to
abolish the slave trade and the development of Amnesty International as two
exemplary and foundational moments in the formation of transnational advocacy
networks around questions of human rights. This track of the course serves as
an introduction to human rights activism as a mode of legal and political
practice. The second track (second meetings of the week) involves a practical
component that offers a case-specific opportunity to learn about and
participate in a human rights advocacy effort. For this component, we will be
working with the human rights organization Scholars at Risk (SAR) in their
efforts to support detained or threatened Uyghur scholars in China. In this
sense, we will learn about the history and contemporary context of the Uyghur
community, familiarize ourselves with efforts of SAR and specific Uyghur
activists around this issue, and develop a collective contribution to the
existing mobilizations around the fate of a specific detained Uyghur scholar
(TBD).","Human Rights","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/hrp.html"

much of the 20th century, Civil Rights activists and Human Rights
advocates worked hand-in-hand. Their shared target: state actors and global
systems that exploited human bodies and denied human dignity in the name of
prejudice, nationalism and profit. Yet in the 1960s, a new wave of social
movements representing Black, Feminist, LGBTQ, Chicano, Indigenous and Disabled
perspectives shattered this consensus, demanding an identity-based approach to
civil rights advocacy and pushing against notions of universal human rights. This
seminar will introduce students to the history of this conflict, and allow them
to explore for themselves the benefits and/or costs of advocating for social
justice through the figure of “the human” or through the filter of identity.
Students will be introduced to the foundational writings of identity-based
movement leaders, with an eye for their applicability to contemporary struggles
over immigration, anti-trans violence, mass incarceration and police violence.
We will consider the relative efficacy of direct action, lawsuits, media
campaigns and civil disobedience.","Human Rights","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/hrp.html"

question has gained increasing salience as the world has become more
globalized. With globalization new problems surface that cut across national
borders and fall outside the jurisdiction of individual nation-states. In
response new forms of political organization have emerged to address these
problems, which challenge the state as the primary locus of political authority
and ultimate source of individual rights. In particular, these individuals and
groups have appealed to a kind of global citizenship from below to call for
action on and demand redress for the harms created by globalization. This
interdisciplinary course critically examines the conceptual and theoretical
foundations of the concept of global citizenship and investigates how the idea
might work in practice. We begin by considering the conceptual, philosophical
and historical debates about citizenship. What does it mean to be a citizen of
a particular state? What obligations and responsibilities accompany
citizenship? How have understandings of citizenship changed and expanded over
time? What is global citizenship and how does it differ from national
citizenship? Next we evaluate these ideas about citizenship in the context of
globalization and the new problems created by an increasingly interdependent
world. Topics covered may include: migration and refugees; the environment and
resources; (in)security and borders; health and infectious disease; and
development and inequality. We conclude by assessing the role (if any) global
citizenship can play in global governance and consider how the international
system might be transformed to better address the challenges of globalization.
This course will be taught concurrently at Bard’s international partner
institutions. Students will benefit from collaboration with peers at these
institutions.","Human Rights","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/hrp.html"

contestations of Marxism, structuralism & psychoanalysis central to
post-’68 feminist theory and “second-wave feminism.” Students will become
familiar with topics such as classical psychoanalytic and post-structuralist
theories of sexual difference, écriture feminine, The “feminist sex wars,” and
70s debates surrounding the NOW & ERA movements, before turning in the
final segment of the course to issues of race & class at the center of “third

discourse, the course is framed from a global human rights perspective, always
mindful of issues such as suffrage, property rights & Equal Pay, forced
marriage, reproductive rights & maternal mortality, female genital

is a fundamental and daunting problem for human rights. This reading and writing
seminar explores different methods for the observation and description of
complex historical and cultural situations, focusing on the violence and
injustice that human rights reporting seeks to expose and challenge.
Documenting them is difficult in the extreme. We set out to re-appropriate
reality, to get at perception before it has been shaped as expression, to read
images and words in the heart and eye before they harden as categories, styles,
definitions – and if it is possible to do so, to reconcile the layers of
meanings and to pull from all these contradictions some organized proce– where
the documentary act begins. We will focus on visual and semiotic awareness, not
as an illustration of ideas, but as a seed for ideas in themselves. We will try,
through examples and assignments, to investigate how non-professionals can use
not only current technologies but also new attitudes so that human rights
reporting can be formalized in such a way as to escape its own dreary ghetto
and become as serious and as urgent as it ought to be. This is an OSUN online

a number of countries and regions and will include a selection of the following
(based on interest and the availability of visitors): the end of apartheid in
South Africa, campaigns against female genital cutting in Kenya and Sudan,
resource extraction in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, genocide in
Rwanda, the trial of the Derg regime in Ethiopia, the
resurgence of slavery amid civil war in Sudan, the fate of sexual minorities in
Uganda, and, lastly, debates in Nigeria over the return of cultural heritage

police as essential to social order including: the procedural, the police
sit-com, the “female cop drama,” “anti-hero” cop shows like NYPD Blue, science

global history of literature and human rights from the sixteenth century to the
present. While human rights are often, and importantly, read through legal
documents and declarations, this class will complement the political and
juridical traditions of human rights by exploring the central ways in which
human rights discourses have been addressed, defined and advanced through
literary texts. Beginning with early human rights testimonies around settler
colonialism and slavery in the Americas, we will move on to examine
twentieth-century literature that grapples with the Holocaust in Europe,
military dictatorships in Latin America and Southeast Asia, and Apartheid in
South Africa. We will end by considering contemporary texts that confront the
issues of war in the Middle East, immigration and detainment, and the treatment
of refugees. Throughout the term, we will pose such questions as: what exactly
are human rights, and how have they been allocated to particular groups and
denied to others in different places and at different times? How can literature
appeal to the feelings of empathy and collective recognition necessary to
support human rights claims? What strategies do works of art use to bear
witness to human rights violations, compel their audiences to act against
injustice, and help victims heal? What are the possibilities and limits of the
written word in the face of the inarticulable, and of aesthetic representation
in the face of atrocity and trauma? In our search for answers, we will examine
a range of literary genres, from autobiography and testimony to the graphic
novel, drama and poetry. Readings may include works by Bartolomé de las Casas,
Olaudah Equiano, Harriet Jacobs, Vladimir Nabokov, Art Spiegelman, Ariel

Visiting Lecturer Dr. Marie Luise Knott in October 2023 (2nd to
27th of October). It is taught in conjunction with the Hannah Arendt
Center Fall Conference on Friendship and Politics.  In 1936 Hannah Arendt described the
German-Jewish author Rahel Varnhagen as her “really best friend, who
unfortunately died 100 years ago”. In conversation with her letters her
personal writings and with contemporary witnesses, she started her biography
Rahel Varnhagen. The Life of a Jewess. Later, in 1945, when Hannah Arendt sent
her essay Zionism Reconsidered to Henry Hurwitz, the editor of Menorah Journal,
she wrote: “I am afraid of my Zionist friends, that is the truth and not a
brave one. But they are the kind of people I never wanted to hurt. It is the
old story of amicus Plato, amicus Socrates sed magis amica veritas. Brrrr
period!” (A Friend to Plato, A friend to Socrates, but above all a friend to
truth. Brrrr period.)  This course asks:
what is a conversation and how is friendship involved here? And: what is the
impact of conversations on the thinking paths of this female thinker? What can
we discover when standing in her library, when reading her essays, her letters,
when looking at poems dedicated to her? 
This workshop is also an exploration of different forms of reading. We
will start reading Arendt’s ideas of how to live in Dark Times.  Exploring Arendt’s personal library on the
Bard campus, we will encounter writers and thinkers who were her friends or
correspondents, such as W.H. Auden, James Baldwin or Bertolt Brecht; W.E.B. Du
Bois, Mary McCarthy, Ralph Ellison, Nathalie Sarraute, Elizabeth Sewell,
Socrates and Ted Weiss. During the workshop the students will read different
documents from Arendt’s library and send their reflections of the quality and
kind of conversation inherent in it. Every week one student will present their
view on the document as a “conversation” with one of the documents, either as a
drama, a poem, a research-report or as a podcast.","Human Rights","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/hrp.html"

famously noted, despite claims of universal rights, the ‘right to have rights’
has come to depend on citizenship and nationhood. International human rights
makes only minor and narrow concessions to people who cross a border without a
government’s permission. As migration increases – because of violence, climate
change, economics – the conflict between human rights and border enforcement
takes on new proportions, leading to increasingly well documented deaths and
violence, both, at the border and beyond. United States border enforcement runs
from Central America to bus stations in upstate New York, and meat packing
plants in Iowa. And the power of the border police is even extended to policing
protesters, as happened in Portland, Oregon and Black Lives Matter protests in
2020. In Europe, border control extends across the Mediterranean sea into the
Middle East and across the Sahara. This seminar explores the border’s impact on
human rights from the perspective of theory, law and advocacy-related case studies.
The class will be begin with readings in political theory and law, drawing from
authors including Hannah Arendt, Etienne Balibar, Reece Jones, Linda Bosniak,
and Michael Walzer, and will explore the rich debate about borders and refugees
elicited by the work of Georgio Agamben. Case studies will highlight the work
of researchers and advocates in law, geography, forensic architecture, and
humanitarian assistance who are confronting the state directly, as well as
anti-immigration or pro-enforcement groups. We will look at the claims made in
the name of (universal) human rights to resist and denounce state practices
that draw authority from the border, as well as rights claims made in support
of border enforcement practices. In addition to engaging with readings and
other assignments, students will undertake research leading to class
presentation and a final project that may be a research paper or other agreed
format.","Human Rights","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/hrp.html"

Evidence would seem to be a matter of facts, far from the realm of literary or
artistic invention. But, whether as fact or fiction, we are regularly
confronted by all sorts of signs that (might) bear witness to an occurrence.
When we read the traces of things left behind at this or that scene, of a crime
for instance, questions of interpretation, presentation, even rhetoric, arise
immediately.  Confronted with evidence, we need to make decisions, form conclusions,
reach judgments. This seminar examines various forms of evidence presented in
the context of claims made for human rights and justice. On the basis of the
traces of what is no longer present—whether in the form of statistics, stains,
rubble, graves, documents, photos, videos, social media postings, or
testimony—we have to decide, and risk making claims about the truth of what
happened. This is necessary because evidence can mislead, or even lie, and is
often ignored or suppressed or denied. The complexities of a ‘post-truth’
world, and new modes of political defiance in relation to evidence, make this
even more urgent.  Through many case studies (from the Shoah to police
violence to war crimes to Mediterranean migrant shipwrecks), as well as historical
and theoretical accounts, we will examine the centrality of evidence in
political and ethical disputes today. Readings include texts and projects by
Forensic Architecture, Kate Doyle, Kimberle Crenshaw and Gary Peller, Lawrence
Weschler, Shoshana Felman, Judith Butler, Bruno Latour, Eric Stover, Patrick
Ball, Ariella Azoulay, Georges Didi-Huberman, and others.","Human Rights","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/hrp.html"

possess a strange remnant of royal sovereignty: the power of executive
clemency, by which they can pardon offenses or commute the sentences of people
convicted of crimes. They can do this to correct injustices, show mercy, or
undo disproportionate punishments. Clemency doesn’t just happen – it requires a
lot of work on the part of the incarcerated person and his or her advocates.
But there are almost no rules governing what a clemency appeal looks like, so
there is significant room for creativity in how applicants present their cases.
In this practical seminar we will join forces with a team of students at CUNY
Law School and the human rights organization WITNESS to prepare short video
presentations that will accompany a number of New York State clemency
applications this fall. Proficiency with video shooting, editing, and an
independent work ethic are important. Meetings with clemency applicants in
prison are a central element of the class. This is an opportunity to work
collaboratively with law students and faculty, to do hands-on human rights
research and advocacy, and to create work that has real-life impact. The class
will alternate between video production and the study of clemency and pardons,
emotion and human rights, first-person narrative, and persuasion by visual
means. Please submit a short statement describing your abilities in shooting
and editing video, and your interest in criminal justice, by May 6th.

global citizen? This question has gained increasing salience as the world has
become more globalized. With globalization new problems surface that cut across
national borders and fall outside the jurisdiction of individual nation-states.
In response new forms of political organization have emerged to address these
problems, which challenge the state as the primary locus of political authority
and ultimate source of individual rights. In particular, these individuals and
groups have appealed to a kind of global citizenship from below to call for
action on and demand redress for the harms created by globalization. This
interdisciplinary course critically examines the conceptual and theoretical
foundations of the concept of global citizenship and investigates how the idea
might work in practice. We begin by considering the conceptual, philosophical
and historical debates about citizenship. What does it mean to be a citizen of
a particular state? What obligations and responsibilities accompany
citizenship? How have understandings of citizenship changed and expanded over
time? What is global citizenship and how does it differ from national
citizenship? Next we evaluate these ideas about citizenship in the context of
globalization and the new problems created by an increasingly interdependent
world. Topics covered may include: migration and refugees; the environment and
resources; (in)security and borders; health and infectious disease; and
development and inequality. We conclude by assessing the role (if any) global
citizenship can play in global governance and consider how the international
system might be transformed to better address the challenges of globalization.
This course will be taught concurrently at Bard’s international partner
institutions. Students will benefit from collaboration with peers at these
institutions.","Global and International Studies","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/gis.html"

the globe. While we are familiar with fascism in the early part of the 20th
century in Germany, Italy and Spain, it goes less noticed that fascism is
currently one of the momentous transformations sweeping the world. Fascism is
resurgent in the US, Russia, China, India, Southeast Asia, and Africa. 
This begs the question of what fascism is in the global South, and how we might
trace a history of fascism from its modern day origins in Germany, Italy and
Spain to Taiwan, China, Japan, Russia, South America, Southeast Asia and
Africa.  In this course we will use India as the paradigmatic case of the
most successful post-colonial democracy in the world which in a short fifty
years after independence has veered towards a distinctive form of fascism which
derives from the Nazi paradigm but with important variations drawing from local
inspiration. This class will think about the origins of fascism in the third
world/Global South in comparative perspective. Readings will focus on the South
and Southeast Asian cases in a global context, ending with India and the USA.","Global and International Studies","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/gis.html"

system since the advent of agriculture and urbanization 10,000 years ago. This
course explores how natural and human systems are connected, and how global
problems such as climate change, biodiversity loss, species extinction are
linked with one another and with social problems such as financial instability,
widening economic inequality, food insecurity, intensifying conflict, and
public health. We review the empirical evidence of these “wicked problems”, and
introduce core concepts and methodologies from natural, and social sciences
perspectives, together with practical skills that are required to tackle these
issues. We will contemplate alternative political and socioeconomic options
(from indigenous knowledge to shared socioeconomic pathways) and will explore
how impacts of these decisions on future natural and human systems can be
assessed (foresight work). Issues will be considered at a variety of
scales—from the level of individual responsibility to the local, regional,
national, and global dimensions. The course includes a community service
component, labs, and guest lectures.  It
will be co-taught by instructors in the natural and social sciences.","Environmental and Urban Studies","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/envstudies.html"

and projected human-made changes compare to natural variability, and discuss
implications of climate change to human and natural systems. Climate policies,
climate justice, pathways and strategies for adaptation and mitigation are
further topics of this course. This course has a lab component in which
physical principles are explored in hands-on experiments and data analyses.
Climate issues of special interest to the students will be explored in a
semester-long project. The course has no prerequisites but basic knowledge of

ecosystem degradation, and wastewater treatment. Lab work will be guided by
scientific questions being asked by local community leaders, including
detection of anthropogenic influence, management and maintenance of water
resources,  and frontiers of managing
emerging contaminants like PFAS and antibiotic resistance genes. Prerequisites:

this course, students work in teams to develop their own ideas for non-profit
or for-profit businesses that work to solve social and environmental
challenges. The course combines in-person
instruction with a global classroom,
where students convene each week in a common zoom space to share ideas.
Participating schools include BRAC University in Bangladesh, Al Quds University
in Palestine, the American Universities of Central Asia (in Kyrgyzstan) and of
Bulgaria, Universidad de Los Andes in Colombia, and Bard. Past certificate courses
have incubated powerful social business ideas in Bangladesh, Palestine and the US.  The course culminates in a “shark tank
for sustainability” among and between teams from the different universities.
The course includes readings and discussion focused on social issues related to
entrepreneurship: drivers of change, from decarbonization to AI; delinking
growth from material throughput; urban-based innovation ecosystems; social
obstacles to risk taking; working on multi-disciplinary teams; language, power
and gender dynamics in entrepreneurship; deconstructing the archetypes of
entrepreneurship.","Environmental and Urban Studies","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/envstudies.html"

receive formal instruction in the fundamentals of using spatial information, conducting
spatial analysis, and producing high-quality cartographic products. Students
will learn how GIS may be used as a tool for identifying and assessing
environmental justice (EJ) issues at the local, regional and global scale.
Students will apply these GIS skills and knowledge base to a team-based
research project focused on an environmental justice problem. The course
culminates in a presentation workshop session, where students show their
analysis and results to their peers, professors and the greater Bard
community.  Students complete a
semester-long course project which applies GIS analysis tools and knowledge of
spatial thinking and human geography to analyze a problem, research question,
or policy question related to environmental justice. The project will allow the
students to apply their GIS knowledge to analyze problems discussed in their
other classes, in their community, or areas of interest. Students are
encouraged to focus their work in such a way that allows them to meaningfully
and productively engage with a community impacted by the topic of their
project.","Environmental and Urban Studies","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/envstudies.html"

this class will help us track and navigate the larger political context that
has provided openings for the modern environmental movement to emerge in the
United States during the 1960s, and the advancement and retrenchment of
environmental law and policies over time, both at the domestic and

spectral spaces throughout its national narratives. Like a haunted house,
America holds onto certain terrors and traumas long after the original
events and people have gone. Through history, literature, and film, this course
examines such spaces and the ghosts and undead swirling in public memory at the
edges of our supposed reality. We will consider how ghosts both distract from
and center historical accounts, including: 
the haunted Gettysburg battlefield and the history of the Civil War; the
yoga and magic workshops of Salem, Massachusetts, and the Puritan witch craze;
and contemporary racial unrest and the ghosts of enslaved and murdered Native
Americans and Africans. American hauntings are experienced as personal and
multi-generational. In William Faulkner’s Light in August, it is the dead “that
do the damage.” We will study this phenomenon in works by Edgar Allan Poe,
Charles Brockden Brown, Shirley Jackson, Jordan Peele, Victor La Salle and
others.","American and Indigenous Studies","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/amstudies.html"

transformed the intellectual aims, frames, and methods of music studies over
time – ranging from historic representations of Indigenous music by Euroamerican
composers and scholars, to contemporary aesthetics, philosophies, and research
methodologies articulated by Indigenous artists and scholars. Particular
attention will be paid to the ways in which Indigenous musicians and
communities engage notions of modernity in order to express self-determination,
to engage diverse understandings of place and belonging, to participate in
local and global exchanges, and to revitalize or reclaim traditions that have
been suppressed through the forces of colonization. While “Indigenous” is a
broad descriptor, we will focus on performance cultures from North America.
Many issues, however, will be relevant for political and intellectual
decolonization initiatives across the globe. Students will be expected to develop
an original research project that integrates class discussions and materials
into their own area of specialty.","American and Indigenous Studies","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/amstudies.html"

sector by politicians and scholars over the past three decades. It has come to

its origins in the Scottish Enlightenment and the US Constitution, then trace
these threads through the rise of the not-for-profit sector and focus on the
principles of best practice for organizations generating significant social
impact. The end of the Cold War and the collapse of most socialist states
sparked international enthusiasm in the 1990s for the building of civil society
by means of voluntary non-profit activity, in the belief that strong civil
societies would promote democracy. No one has advanced this principle more
aggressively over the past thirty years than billionaire philanthropist George
Soros and his Open Society Foundations, whose work is based on the philosophy
of Karl Popper. The renewal of civil society in Central and Eastern Europe was
met with enthusiasm in the 1990s, yet over the last decade has been met with
resistance and even hostility by political leadership pivoting toward illiberal
democracy and authoritarianism. We will explore the core elements of civil

including civil society, philanthropy, and the private sector have been engaged
to bring new perspectives, broaden outreach, and improve program

to manage change and develop solutions. The global coronavirus pandemic,
climate change, inequality and injustice, the decline of democracies, rapid
technological change, rising food and commodity prices, and increased refugee

wonder whether the United Nations and international institutions are up to the

institutions and support for global cooperation, Russia's invasion of Ukraine
has raised fundamental questions about their existence and continued

effective. We will examine the roles, responsibilities, and effectiveness of
international institutions in helping to manage global crises, and how the
Biden Administration, UN officials, or other decision-makers should respond. We
will study successes and failures of multilateralism, whether the system is

illiberal politics appear to be winning elections and delivering radical changes
with increasing frequency around the world, from Poland and Hungary, to Israel

we’ll explore “democratic backsliding” from a global perspective, what is meant
by the term, what it looks like, and why it seems to be happening so widely
right now. We’ll look at factors contributing to the rise of the far right,
sources of support for illiberal politics, and whether this politics offers
real solutions to actual problems. Some critics argue that the concept itself
of “illiberal democracy” is an oxymoron. But therein lie some of the
difficulties facing liberal societies: where and how do we draw a distinction
between legitimate disputes among parties within a democratic community, and
behaviors that damage, and potentially destroy, the system itself? Readings for
this course will be interdisciplinary, drawing on critical texts on democratic
erosion, from Daniel Ziblatt and Steven Levitsky, and Ivan Krastev and Stephen
Holmes, as well as recent theoretical writings on democracy, its
vulnerabilities, and limits, from Patrick Deneen and Roger Scruton, and
journalistic works, such as those by Anne Applebaum and Isabel Wilkerson. We
will examine case studies, and students will complete a final assignment that
may be devoted to one such case study, an essay or journalistic piece, or
another writing project to be determined with the instructor. An underlying
line of inquiry in this class will be to consider whether (or not) we may be
entering into a “post-liberal” era, and what that might mean for the future of
the democratic institutions – the media, civil society, schools and
universities, museums, the courts – within which many of us will seek to make

realm is its anarchic political structure. Anarchy, it is often assumed, makes
cooperation among states more difficult, suggests violence and war are
inextricable features of the system, and leads to a narrow understanding of
power as simple coercion. The resulting picture of international political life
is bleak, with states resigned to reproducing patterns of conflict, war, and
exploitation. This course—through a critical examination of International
Relations’ foundational concepts of anarchy, violence and power—interrogates
this rendering of international politics and in doing so provides an
introduction to competing theories about the structure, functioning, and
transformative potential of the international system. How do states create and
maintain order in a condition of anarchy? 
What forms of political violence are privileged in thinking about
international life, and to what effect? 
How do assumptions about anarchy, and the kinds of politics it
encourages, shape how we understand the ways states wield power (in all its
forms) to achieve their interests? 
Throughout the course an effort will be made to illustrate the
importance of theoretical and conceptual disagreements for thinking about

Why aren't there more
women in leadership positions? According to a 2018 Pew Research Center report,
the majority of American men and women acknowledge the capacity of women to
lead. Yet in certain domains--most notably politics and business-- continue
to be under-represented at the top and the American public remains
skeptical that gender parity can be achieved.  Recent elections have
galvanized the electorate around constructions of gender in particularly
dramatic ways.  If we are living in a post-feminist society (as some
claim), why do these questions and conflicts continue to arise? Identity is an
urgent conversation in 21st-century politics and everyday life, and this
includes awareness of how intersectionality shapes gendered experiences. What
are the stories that we tell ourselves and each other about equality,
representation, privilege, freedom, authority, and success? How do these
inflect real-world outcomes for individuals and societies?  In this
two-credit course we will explore some of the stories that circulate in our
culture around women and power, both from an academic and from a practical,
real-world perspective. What does it mean to lead? How do we use a language of
empowerment? Why has the United States embraced certain narratives of gender
equity and success as opposed to those being created in other countries and
cultures? We will focus on learning from women who are committed to making a
difference in the world through their personal and professional choices,
hearing their stories, and reading texts that have been particularly important
to them in their lives and work. So too, we will engage with stories from the
past (archival research), from across disciplines (government,
politics, the military, higher education, STEM, the arts, tech, media) and from
a wide range of perspectives.  As an Engaged Liberal Arts and

based in political activism, community engagement, or work experience. Drawing

This question has gained increasing salience as the world has become more globalized.
With globalization new problems surface that cut across national borders and
fall outside the jurisdiction of individual nation-states. In response new
forms of political organization have emerged to address these problems, which
challenge the state as the primary locus of political authority and ultimate
source of individual rights. In particular, these individuals and groups have
appealed to a kind of global citizenship from below to call for action on and
demand redress for the harms created by globalization. This interdisciplinary
course critically examines the conceptual and theoretical foundations of the
concept of global citizenship and investigates how the idea might work in
practice. We begin by considering the conceptual, philosophical and historical
debates about citizenship. What does it mean to be a citizen of a particular
state? What obligations and responsibilities accompany citizenship? How have
understandings of citizenship changed and expanded over time? What is global
citizenship and how does it differ from national citizenship? Next we evaluate
these ideas about citizenship in the context of globalization and the new
problems created by an increasingly interdependent world. Topics covered may
include: migration and refugees; the environment and resources; (in)security
and borders; health and infectious disease; and development and inequality. We
conclude by assessing the role (if any) global citizenship can play in global
governance and consider how the international system might be transformed to
better address the challenges of globalization. This course will be taught
concurrently at Bard’s international partner institutions. Students will
benefit from collaboration with peers at these institutions.","Politics","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/politicalstudies.html"

have little connection to justice. As the novelist William Gaddis writes:
“Justice? You get justice in the next world. In this world, you have the law.”
This course explores the apparent disconnect between law and justice. Can
contemporary legal systems offer justice? Can we, today, still speak of a duty

devastating effects, it remains a vital element of our collective international
system—a political system that many find acceptable and desirable, despite the
death and destruction it can cause. While the past few years have seen a rise
in (inter)national discussions of abolitionist politics centering on carceral
politics, policing, and nuclear weapons, there has not been a similarly high

flourishing of anti-war movements whose activism for peace included efforts to
outlaw war entirely, most famously codified in the 1928 Kellogg-Briand Pact
prohibiting war. This class will use abolitionist politics in other
contemporary contexts—e.g. anti-nuclear, anti-prison, and anti-police movements—as
a lens for investigating war abolition. It will also explore pacifist theory

philosophia, meaning “love of wisdom.” What did it mean to “love wisdom” in
ancient Greek societies, and what might it mean to us today? This course
invites students into the discipline of philosophy through a critical
consideration of its origins in ancient Greece. Philosophy emerged in the sixth
and fifth centuries BCE in a context of rapid urbanization, expanding literacy,
colonial warfare, and democratic experimentation. Without any established
academic disciplines or traditions, the early Greek thinkers we now call the
“first philosophers” experimented with an astonishing variety of forms and
practices, including scientific observation, cryptic aphorisms, poetic
narratives, and dramatic dialogue. As we follow the emergence of distinctively
“philosophical” ways of thinking and living, we will also trace the shifting
relations of philosophy to other modes of thought in ancient Greek culture,
such as poetry, religion, theater, and politics. The course centers on the
enigmatic figure of Socrates, in whose intellectual circle the term
“philosophy” first came into common use. We will consider the conflicting
accounts of Socrates and his circle that we find in the historian Xenophon, the
comedian Aristophanes, and the tragedian Plato. Alongside this paradigmatic
philosopher, we will also consider other thinkers who have a more contested
relationship to the philosophical canon, including the so-called “Presocratics”
and the Sophists. In taking up the question of who counts as a philosopher and
what counts as philosophy in Greek antiquity, we will attend to the role of
class, gender and sexuality in the formation of philosophical communities. This
course satisfies the Philosophy program’s Histories of Philosophy requirement.

of thought developing from and responding to but also moving beyond
structuralism. Drawing neat historical divisions in thought can be tricky, yet this
course offers students the opportunity to examine these movements with
sufficient context to identify Poststructuralism’s debts to Structuralism, as
well as its critical departures. The course is divided into four parts. 1) We
begin by examining core ideas of structuralism that develop in the field of
linguistics (Saussure, Jakobson, Benvéniste) and tackle the basic structuralist
proposition that beneath the variable surface phenomena of human culture there
exist governing relations of abstract structure. 2) Pursuing the idea that
human culture can be grasped by means of deep structures modeled on language,
we turn to examine authors who adapt structural analysis for disciplines beyond
linguistics, including anthropology (Lévi-Strauss), Marxism (Althusser),
literature (Barthes), and psychoanalysis (Lacan). 3) We then turn to social
constructionism and consider how Foucault views power and knowledge to operate
in historical constructions of the subject. 4) Beginning with an overview of
structuralism’s perceived limitations, for the remainder of the course we
grapple with some core concerns in poststructuralist thought, such as the
instability of meaning in language (Derrida), capitalism and desire (Deleuze,
Guattari, Lyotard), reality and simulation, (Baudrillard), identity and
difference, including questions of sexual difference and gender construction
(Irigaray, Kristeva, Cixous, Butler). The course aims to familiarize students
with a range of poststructuralist methodologies, including conceptual analysis,
historicism, social constructionism, discourse analysis, schizoanalysis,
écriture féminine, and deconstruction. Students can expect to acquire a nuanced
grasp of key concepts such as metalanguage, the symbolic and the real,
discourse, biopower, logocentrism, différance, alterity, desiring-production,
and the precession of simulacra.","Philosophy","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/philosophy.html"

of ourselves as fundamentally distinct and separate from what surrounds us. We
lose ourselves in books, escape into t.v. and the internet, and socialize

scientific and virtual worlds has led to a great range of advances, most
notably in the empirical sciences, the world wide web, and globalization, it
has closed off other more physical, local, and embodied ways of feeling and
experiencing the things and the people with whom we share this world. In this

Atomism and imposed necessary limits for any meaningful language.  His
later Philosophical Investigations, written in an informal and instructive

its impact on both local communities and the environment. Central to our

Crusades became one of the most important political, cultural, and symbolic
movements in European history. Not only did they transform the states of the
Latin West, Byzantium, and the Islamic Near East, but the fostered changes in
politics, culture, literature, belief, and devotional practices from Britain to
Persia—as well as providing a set of symbols and narratives that continue to
resonate even in the 21st century. The Crusades may be gone, but
they are hardly forgotten. Though often conceptualized as a clash between
Christian and Muslim civilizations, this course challenges that view with a
pluralist approach, showing students how crusading warfare and beliefs were
also deployed against pagans and indigenous people on Europe’s frontiers,
heterodox Christians, and a range of political opponents. More than a history
of warfare, this course examines intellectual, institutional, and financial
innovations that shaped crusading in the Middle Ages, as well as the ways it
was exported to a globally connected world from the 15th century
onward. Ranging from the 7th century CE to modern America, this
course traces the long arc of crusading: from church councils and popular
campaigns of the High Middle Ages, through the emergence of the Ottomans and
their conquest of the eastern Mediterranean, and into modern appropriations of
crusading in service of imperialism, nationalism, terrorism, and neofascist
politics. Along the way, we will encounter not only zealous preachers and
reluctant soldiers, but also crafty politicians and simple believers, pirates
and princes. The course then intersects with histories of the Mediterranean,
the Latin Middle Ages and Byzantium, the Islamic Near East, the early modern
world, and even modern politics. By the end of the course, students will have a
familiarity with the institutions and beliefs that fostered crusading, and the
ways the memory of the crusades has continued to influence politics and

analytical perspective. Why was the period of openness so brief? How are
Russia’s international politics influenced by the nation’s historical
experiences and internal political and economic crises? And to what extent do
the “Putinist” decades of Russia’s presence on the
global stage depend on this president’s personal opinions, cultural background,

amalgamated paradigms of Soviet foreign relations with an attempt to resolve
internal issues, we will move on to investigating the two major upheavals: the
collapse of the Soviet Union, and the crash of the Yalta-Potsdam system. These
historical milestones will help us frame the Russian foreign affairs of the
early 1990s as a continuation of the Soviet foreign policy, with its focus on
cooperation with the West. Our next subject will be such turning points of

controlled, regulated and gendered in the colonial Middle East, and how they
resisted. Between the mid-nineteenth and early-twentieth century, most of the
Ottoman Empire’s Arab provinces came under British and French colonial rule.
Colonizers deemed the ‘Oriental’ male body weak, insufficiently masculine and
unfit for national service, while the female body was exoticized and
hypersexualized. During the same period, many local governments struggled with foreign
debt, and, consequently, took interest in their populations as a source of
labor power to be exploited. The following decades saw the proliferation of
discourse on sports, labor, chastity, honor, prostitution, and drug addiction.
It also saw the rise of new institutions, including prisons, families, sports
clubs, and police agencies, as sites of contestation between the colonizer and
the colonized. Throughout the course, we will scrutinize the proliferation of
this discourse on ‘Oriental bodies’. We will also explore the role of these
emergent institutions in the gendering bodies, exploiting labor, and organizing

African and European political thought and practices of captivity, especially,
abduction, wartime hostage-taking, slavery, and other forms of internment.
Captivity in the early modern world engages questions of war and ransom as much
as labor, religion, and race. It involves contracts, written or not, for
renting, selling, buying, and freeing people. As such, captivity figures
prominently in the so-called laws of war and peace. The language of the law,
here, indicates varying degrees of legitimacy and becomes a touchstone for the
changing morality of societies–with profound consequences for understandings of
gender and power. Students will write an Africa-centered paper based on primary

between race, religion, and revolution in Latin America from the early
twentieth-century to the present, to understand how these interactions have
mattered to the region’s history and how they explain some of its most violent
current conflicts. The very name “Latin America” derived from and became
associated with specific racial, religious, and revolutionary meanings through
a history of violence. The seminar will begin by studying how racial concepts
formed and became fixed ideas through distinct revolutionary-inspired
intellectual debates on interracial mixture and indigenous rights. Based in
Mexico and Peru, the formation of concepts like global mestizaje, a “cosmic
race,” and indigenismo involved rival valuations of each nation’s indigenous
and colonial histories and cultures, with lasting effects. The seminar will
then explore the simultaneous rise of wars and conflicts over radically different
religious meanings and faiths, within and outside of Catholicism, including
native religions and the rise of Evangelical Protestant Christianity. The
latter part of the seminar will focus on Guatemala, which dramatically combined
extreme violence over race, religion, and revolution, and focused global
attention on indigenous rights and human rights. These histories will allow for
a deeper understanding of the rise of different forms of violence in Central
America today, and therefore of the current human rights, migrant, and refugee
crisis centered there and involving other parts of Latin America and the US.
This seminar emphasizes the narratives, interpretations, and voices of
participants in the history, and critical engagement with these primary sources
in the writing of the history. This course is part of the Racial Justice
Initiative, an interdisciplinary collaboration among students and faculty to
further the understanding of racial inequality and injustice in the United

violent powers of the modern state as they were refined through technologies
and techniques in National Socialist Germany, and then alternately condemned
and utilized in the two German nations of the (East) German Democratic Republic
(DDR) and the (West) German Federal Republic (BRD). Topics will range from the
development of new techniques of propaganda and military oversight to the
manipulation of social technologies such as identification papers, the census,
racial pseudo-science, and, most horrifically, the concentration camp
system.  At the end of the Nazi period,
the DDR defined itself through its resistance to the Nazi party, and nearly the
entirety of its ideology was grounded in anti-Fascism and cosmopolitanism.  The means of organizing and controlling
society were often directly carried over from the Nazi past.  Similarly, the liberal capitalist ideology of
the BRD defined itself in complete opposition to the Nazi past, but here as
well there were surprising number holdovers from the Nazi era, ranging from the
system of registering with the police to the retention of leading
bureaucrats.  By comparing the two
movements, ideologically complete opposites yet organizationally often
surprisingly similar, we can address some of the most disturbing issues of
modern techniques of social control. 
Similarly, protests within each system against specific moments of state
power – ranging from issues such as the use of the census and identity cards to
methods of police surveillance and conscription – were frequently couched in
terms of their links with the Nazi era. 
Please note that the core of this course will be spent writing and
refining an independent historical research paper of approximately 35 pages in
length.  No previous knowledge of German
history is required, although students without such knowledge will need to set
aside time for some background reading.","Historical Studies","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/history.html"

bibliography, identifying an archive, interpreting primary sources, engaging
other historians, and synthesizing an argument. Assignments addressing each of
these steps will contribute to development of the final senior project. The
colloquium will feature collaborative work, in the form of collective

been redefined and contested over the discipline’s long development. The term ‘culture’
opens up major questions. What, if anything, does it mean to be human? How does
our language shape what we can and can’t see in the world? When does difference
create conflict and when does difference inspire gift-giving? This course will
trace the history of the culture concept from the nineteenth century to the
present. In doing so, it will explore anthropological approaches to human
groups, collective rituals, personal symbols, and systems of exchange. It will
examine how anthropology came to focus on questions of identity, race, gender,
labor, sexuality, nationalism, and (post-)colonial power. Our ethnographic gaze
will be turned inward as well as outward. We will therefore consider the
reasons behind, and ramifications of, anthropology’s self-reflexive turn in and
around the 1980s. We will enter debates about anthropologists’ engagement in
activism and policy. We will then examine the more recent anthropological
fascination with the non-human (e.g. other animals, technology, the built
environment, ‘nature’), looking at how notions of selfhood, materiality, and

Sea, dividing the African continent in two. The Nile, one of the world’s
longest rivers, rises in Eastern Africa and flows through the region for most
of its course to Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Between them, the Rift Valley
and the Nile river transect a region of spectacular ecological and cultural
diversity, embracing modes of human existence that range from pastoral nomadism
to the lives of modern city-dwellers. It spans the whole of human history:
fossil evidence indicates that the Rift was where the emergence of modern
humans took place, approximately 200,000 years ago. In the present day,
following waves of globalisation, the lands of the Rift and those of the Nile
Basin have come to exemplify the difficulties that confront much of modern
Africa. These include the legacy of colonialism and anti-colonial struggle,
civil war, the unrestrained exploitation of natural resources, population
pressure, and accelerating environmental change. These processes have led to growing
levels of urbanization, displacement and forced migration. The response of
communities in the region demonstrates the inventiveness of human adaptation
and the drama of survival. The course offers an interdisciplinary approach to
the layers of natural and human history in the region, deploying scholarly
research, reportage, music and documentary film to examine the diverse ways of
being that endure, and the versions of modernity that are emerging from
economic and demographic transformation.. The issues are addressed through a
set of questions and case studies. How do communities in different places
relate to the natural environment? How have they created and understood wealth?
What happens to group identities in a time of mass displacement?  How have successive systems of governance
emerged historically from earlier forms of social organisation? And what is
their fate in the face of inequitable globalisation, civil war and the decay of
states?","Anthropology","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/anthropology.html"

anthropologists’ key informants, and other cultural liaisons who build their

them to save lives while also putting their own lives at risk.  Focusing on the labor of such culture brokers
forces us to ask questions about the constitutive role they play in general understandings
and knowledge about ‘the global world.’ 
We will use a variety of texts, from popular journalism to scholarship
about global culture brokers, to examine how cultural knowledge about a

inanimate or inevitable. Nor is it reducible to “business” or “markets.”  Rather, anthropology helps us recognize that
economic systems are made up of socially and historically situated projects,
practices, ideologies and relationships. Do economic systems produce culture or
does culture shape economic systems? Is there an “economic logic” to everything
we do? Why are certain kinds of work designated “labor” while others are simply
social acts? In this class, we will tackle these questions by drawing on a
variety of readings rooted in feminist and global approaches to the study of
economies and economic life. We will interrogate how race, gender and
colonialism are central to the formation and functioning of capitalism, and how
labor and commodities come to be valued (or devalued) through social processes,
rather than intrinsic market logic. We will explore how mundane, everyday
activities – such as drinking coffee or doing the dishes – can help us think
about large-scale concepts such as political economy, neoliberalism and
globalization. Finally, we will end the course by thinking about the place of

think of as an ‘anthropological question.’ 
We will share fieldnotes and ethnographic research challenges as they
occur and discuss what kinds of methods are appropriate for different research
questions. Students will also have the opportunity to propose texts they would
like for us to discuss together. Students will be required to produce an
annotated bibliography for their projects, at least three revised outlines, and
will produce at least three analytic vignettes and/or flash ethnography pieces
based on fieldwork.  We will devote some
in class time to peer editing other students’ work, reading written work aloud,
and developing a theoretical tool-box for each project.  The course will also include consultations
with a librarian, who will introduce students to relevant (but lesser known)
databases as well as college-supported bibliographic software. Our regular
meeting time will be Mondays 12:30 – 2:50, but some weeks we will also have
additional meetings on select Monday and/or Tuesday evenings.  While this class is required for all
anthropology seniors, it does not replace meetings with senior project advisors
and therefore does not confer any credits.

participation in the colloquium.","Anthropology","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/anthropology.html"

considered ‘normal female’ as opposed to ‘normal male’ behavior. The course
begins with the history of conceptualizing the ‘female madness’ starting from
the witchcraft persecution in Europe to the emergence of diagnostic categories
such as “neurasthenia’ and ‘hysteria’ which were frequently applied to women in
the 19 th and early 20 th centuries. We will discuss biological explanations
used to explain mental disorder in women and associated psychiatric practices
of the past. The key point of the course is to look at how gender roles and
stereotypes may have contributed to definitions of mental illness with varied
impacts on women and men. For example, we will read materials about how women
who deviated from their ascribed gender roles were continuously likely to be
categorized as ‘insane’. In the second part of the course, our focus will be on
how diagnoses have changed over time and the modern day gender biases still
found in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).

of abnormal psychology will be examined throughout the course. Prerequisites:

universal solution. However, with these technologies come a flip side to the

on land-managers and policy-makers to translate relevant scientific findings
into action, perhaps before clear answers emerge in the scientific literature.
The trajectory and tempo of scientific progress often include periods of
ambiguity during which scientists reach opposing conclusions, debating publicly
in the primary literature over months or years as new studies emerge. At times,
these debates can become contentious, in part because of constraints inherent
to the study of ecology that limit the broad application of ecological results
across different ecosystems, and in part because answers differ from our
previous understanding, or have little public appeal. In this course, students
will examine current controversies in the ecological literature. Students will

cultural and intellectual history of Italy from 1943 to 1950, addressing
post-Fascist Italy as a case study in the broader question of establishing
democracy after totalitarianism. The heterogeneous aspects of the Italian
cultural field after WWII are considered in a wide-ranging framework, in which
postwar histories are informed not simply by the external context of the Cold
War but also by preceding wartime discourses. The course encompasses the
ideological debate of the late 1940s, the role of aesthetics in reshaping the
national self (Neorealism and its discontents), and the politics of memory
enacted by literature and film (Italo Calvino, Curzio Malaparte, Carlo Levi).
It also investigates the legacy of violence left by Fascism and the war, the
trauma of national defeat, and Italian responsibility in WWII and the Holocaust
(Primo Levi, Rosetta Loy). Finally, it surveys the persistence of gender and
racial exclusions after the establishment of a new democracy. Prerequisites:

in French, from the 18th century to our days, this class will focus on
short texts (poems, plays, essays, letters, short stories) that reflect the
fragile relationship between selfhood and authenticity. From Rousseau’s
ambitious program of autobiography to Ndiaye’s project of paranoid
self-portraiture, literature in French has staged with relish the classic
tension between art, artifice, and authenticity and the ways in which this
tension relates to forms of politics, power and postcoloniality. This has not
only inaugurated an intensely individual and unstable relationship to the
notion of truth, but has implicated the reader in this destabilizing process.
This class will explore how the quest for authenticity has led to radical
reevaluations of literary style. Readings from Rousseau, Lamartine, Hugo,
Balzac, Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Apollinaire, Édouard, Ponge, Sartre, Camus,
Ernaux, Chamoiseau, Condé, Ndiaye, and others. Taught in French. By addressing

BCE) are the twin pillars upon which the Western literary tradition stands;
between them, these two titanic works explore issues of human life and
civilization—mortality and heroism; the relationships between the human and the
divine, men and women, free will and fate; the confrontation between European
and other cultures; the nature of poetry, tragedy and comedy—that have remained
central ever since. This course, designed to introduce freshmen to more
profound and sophisticated techniques of reading and thinking about literary
texts than they will have thus far encountered, will consist of an intensive
reading of both epics in their entirety over the course of one semester,
focusing on in-depth discussion and textual explication, with a heavy emphasis
on how to write critically about literary texts.  After two prefatory sessions, in which
students will be introduced to the large concerns of the epic genre in general
(archaic Greek civilization, the epic cycle, oral composition, the Homeric
Question) and of these two works in particular (the “heroic code,” violence and
warfare, the clash of civilizations, ethnography and exploration, homecoming
narratives, marriage), we will read through the epics at a rate of two books
per session, two sessions per week. Students will be introduced, by means of
excerpts and shorter articles, to the immense scholarship on Homer, especially
with respect to oral composition and the Homeric Question.","Classical Studies","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/classic.html"

violence and white supremacist organizing, a time when most of us seek safety, not
risk. Poetry, however, is a way toward thinking through what it means to be
human in any context, whether we can recognize the world as ours or not. It has
the capacity to shift our thinking—about sentence structures, about habitual
patterns of thought, about what might be possible in the future. Poetry helps
us recalibrate the already known so that we may re-see what appears ordinary or
immutable. In this course you’ll generate new poems that push the boundaries of
what you already know about what a poem might be. In creative practice, we’ll
investigate this notion of risk. Readings will include work by Fred Moten,

arrived on the U.S. literary scene in 1974, it was both manifesto and
provocation, inflaming still-ongoing debates over the borders, sensibilities, obligations,
and political allegiances of the “Asian American writer.” Since the entrance of
Aiiieeeee and the beginnings of the Asian American Movement in the late 1960’s,
Asian American poetry has expanded to cover vast political and aesthetic
terrain, though knotted questions remain over what designating a work as “Asian
American” allows us to see and understand. 
In this course, we’ll examine the aesthetic heterogeneity and
capaciousness of this slippery category through the lens of contemporary AAPI
and Asian diaspora poets who write in invigoratingly diverse modes, forms,
styles, and visions. How do contemporary AAPI poets innovate poetically to
address evolving concerns of the AAPI community? How do works by these poets
deepen or destabilize our understanding of race and racialization? Course
readings will include the poetry of Nellie Wong, Garrett Hongo, Theresa Cha,
Bhanu Kapil, Rajiv Mohabir, Monica Youn, Vijay Seshadri, Li-Young Lee, Solmaz

between politics and aesthetics. In tandem with the course texts, students will
write their own poetry, and engage in interdisciplinary modes of response. This

is the great idol of our age.  It
divorces leisure from labor and turns life into a series of utilitarian dead
ends.  Conversely, the impulse to play,
to engage in gratuitous moments of being, in seemingly evanescent
conversations, might be our only chance to convert specialized knowledge into
self-knowledge. Since Socrates, conversation has been admired for its seemless
ability to perform thinking, to integrate knowledge into society, and to
supplement savoir (knowledge) with savoir-vivre (the art of living).  But conversation, precisely because it
clashes with the useful, has often been condemned as merely artful, dangerous
for its proximity to the decadent and the idle.   But what is so threatening about
idleness?  According to Nietzsche,
because idleness leads to self-reflection, we avoid it by mindlessly embracing
work.  The work ethic has become an
excuse for not thinking about the desperate human condition.. Paradoxically,
work has become an escapist diversion and the time to rest and to converse
has  being usurped by the false plenitude
of mechanical labor.  Proust’s In Search of Lost Time adds a new twist to this dichotomy:
for the social-climber, conversation becomes work, a laborious exercise in
appearing rather than being.   This
course examines how these tensions are played both on a rhetorical  (we will read diverse narratological studies
on conversation, studying the use of silences, repetition, dialogue, etc.) and
on a thematic level.  After reading a
selection of critiques of ‘pure’ work (Aristotle, Schiller, Marx, and
Nietzsche), we will examine texts  that expose
the vanity of conversation (Pascal’s Pensées, Molière’s Misanthrope),  novels that thematize the tensions between
work and conversation as social and cultural phenomena  (Henry James, The Europeans, Updike Rabbit
Run), and works that offer up possible aesthetic theories of conversation
(Proust, Swann’s Way and Against Sainte Beuve). 
We will also scrutinize instances where conversation becomes a mere
filler (Beckett’s Waiting for Godot). 
Students will also read Paul Lafargue’s In Praise of Idleness and
Corinne Maier’s Laziness, the recent French bestseller attacking the
dangers of work. This course is a Literature Junior Seminar course.","Junior Seminars","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/litseminar.htm"

eroticism of Nabokov’s masterwork not only as a matter of plot,

aesthetics of sexual desire for Nabokov is inseparable from language – a
physiological, cognitive, and symbolic medium that can affect the reader both
on the level of sound (alliteration, friction, tension, etc.) as well as
through figurative speech, with its multiplicity of connotations and allusions
(hidden messages are like taboos: we desire to break them). Lolita, the novel
we will be reading and re-reading in class, was written in English, which
Nabokov acquired and adopted, rather than being born into. We will investigate
the impact Nabokov’s complicated relationship with the language had on his
writing techniques and stylistic choices. We will also explore strategies of
narrative concealment Nabokov used in order to seduce, mislead, and even
morally blind his readers. Among the texts offered for study and discussion,

the sonnet: rule-bound, artificial, and old-fashioned. The funny thing is, the
poets writing in the English Renaissance tried everything they could to make
their poems appear as just the opposite: organic, sincere, and excitingly new.
When they realized that their experiments were failures, they also came to see
the failures as interesting in new ways. What resulted was a period of wild and
flourishing literary inventiveness. Beginning with the reign of Queen Elizabeth
I and ending around the tumultuous English Civil Wars and the regicide of King
Charles I, the century spanning 1550 to 1650 in English history was responsible
for grand upheavals in culture, religion, politics, and science. Accordingly,
just beneath the veneer of formal qualities like rhyme and meter, poems from
the period are sensitive and probing explorations of chaos, frustration,
madness, desire, and the sublime. By focusing on experiences of error,
uncertainty, shame, and failure, this course examines how Renaissance poets
fought with language as they tried to say things that they did not know how to
say. Through both critical and creative exercises, students will develop an
approach to writing unafraid of failure and emboldened by experiences of
risk-taking. We’ll hone a deep understanding of essential aspects of poetry
while we think about how it was (and still is) a tool for thought and an
instrument of emotional understanding. The course covers a broad range of major
works as well as less commonly-read (yet indelibly great) poetry—especially
poetry by women. Shakespeare, Spenser, and Donne will take their place in
context alongside poets like Isabella Whitney, Mary Wroth, Katherine Philips,
George Herbert, and Amelia Lanyer. This is a pre-1800 Literature course

is the great idol of our age.  It
divorces leisure from labor and turns life into a series of utilitarian dead
ends.  Conversely, the impulse to play,
to engage in gratuitous moments of being, in seemingly evanescent conversations,
might be our only chance to convert specialized knowledge into self-knowledge.
Since Socrates, conversation has been admired for its seemless ability to
perform thinking, to integrate knowledge into society, and to supplement savoir
(knowledge) with savoir-vivre (the art of living).  But conversation, precisely because it
clashes with the useful, has often been condemned as merely artful, dangerous
for its proximity to the decadent and the idle.   But what is so threatening about
idleness?  According to Nietzsche,
because idleness leads to self-reflection, we avoid it by mindlessly embracing
work.  The work ethic has become an
excuse for not thinking about the desperate human condition.. Paradoxically,
work has become an escapist diversion and the time to rest and to converse
has  being usurped by the false plenitude
of mechanical labor.  Proust’s In Search
of Lost Time adds a new twist to this dichotomy: for the social-climber,
conversation becomes work, a laborious exercise in appearing rather than
being.   This course examines how these
tensions are played both on a rhetorical 
(we will read diverse narratological studies on conversation, studying
the use of silences, repetition, dialogue, etc.) and on a thematic level.  After reading a selection of critiques of
'pure' work (Aristotle, Schiller, Marx, and Nietzsche), we will examine
texts  that expose the vanity of
conversation (Pascal's Pensées, Molière's Misanthrope),  novels that thematize the tensions between
work and conversation as social and cultural phenomena  (Henry James, The Europeans, Updike Rabbit
Run), and works that offer up possible aesthetic theories of conversation
(Proust, Swann's Way and Against Sainte Beuve). 
We will also scrutinize instances where conversation becomes a mere filler
(Beckett's Waiting for Godot).  Students
will also read Paul Lafargue's In Praise of Idleness and Corinne Maier’s
Laziness, the recent French bestseller attacking the dangers of work. This
course is a Literature Junior Seminar course.","300 and 400 Level Courses","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/lit3courses.html"

through figurative speech, with its multiplicity of connotations and allusions

others framed their tales within the metaphoric landscapes of ruined abbeys and

the se fundentally dark artistic vision, later masters radically reinvented and
contemporized tropes, settings, and narrative strategies to create a new era in
this tradition. Identified as the New Gothic, this phase appears to have risen
in tandem with a parallel literary phenomenon, termed by speculative fiction
theorist John Clute as Fantastika, whose achievement is to have taken the
genres of the fantastic, fabular, and horror in a similar groundbreaking
literary direction. While not dismissing the fundamental spirit that animates

Why aren't there more
women in leadership positions? According to a 2018 Pew Research Center report,
the majority of American men and women acknowledge the capacity of women to
lead. Yet in certain domains--most notably politics and business-- continue
to be under-represented at the top and the American public remains
skeptical that gender parity can be achieved.  Recent elections have
galvanized the electorate around constructions of gender in particularly
dramatic ways.  If we are living in a post-feminist society (as some
claim), why do these questions and conflicts continue to arise? Identity is an
urgent conversation in 21st-century politics and everyday life, and this
includes awareness of how intersectionality shapes gendered experiences. What
are the stories that we tell ourselves and each other about equality,
representation, privilege, freedom, authority, and success? How do these
inflect real-world outcomes for individuals and societies?  In this
two-credit course we will explore some of the stories that circulate in our
culture around women and power, both from an academic and from a practical,
real-world perspective. What does it mean to lead? How do we use a language of
empowerment? Why has the United States embraced certain narratives of gender
equity and success as opposed to those being created in other countries and
cultures? We will focus on learning from women who are committed to making a
difference in the world through their personal and professional choices,
hearing their stories, and reading texts that have been particularly important
to them in their lives and work. So too, we will engage with stories from the
past (archival research), from across disciplines (government,
politics, the military, higher education, STEM, the arts, tech, media) and from
a wide range of perspectives.  As an Engaged Liberal Arts and
Sciences course, this seminar will provide students with the unique opportunity
to bring theory and practice together in a very immediate sense: by the end of
the term you will have identified a story only you can tell, whether it is
based in political activism, community engagement, or work experience. Drawing
on the rich resources here in Annandale as well as through Bard's other
campuses we will reach out to groups and organizations with a shared focus on
gender. Network building is something we will explicitly
address.  This course is open to all first-year students. Upper

the sonnet: rule-bound, artificial, and old-fashioned. The funny thing is, the
poets writing in the English Renaissance tried everything they could to make
their poems appear as just the opposite: organic, sincere, and excitingly new.
When they realized that their experiments were failures, they also came to see
the failures as interesting in new ways. What resulted was a period of wild and
flourishing literary inventiveness. Beginning with the reign of Queen Elizabeth
I and ending around the tumultuous English Civil Wars and the regicide of King
Charles I, the century spanning 1550 to 1650 in English history was responsible
for grand upheavals in culture, religion, politics, and science. Accordingly,
just beneath the veneer of formal qualities like rhyme and meter, poems from
the period are sensitive and probing explorations of chaos, frustration,
madness, desire, and the sublime. By focusing on experiences of error,
uncertainty, shame, and failure, this course examines how Renaissance poets
fought with language as they tried to say things that they did not know how to
say. Through both critical and creative exercises, students will develop an
approach to writing unafraid of failure and emboldened by experiences of
risk-taking. We’ll hone a deep understanding of essential aspects of poetry
while we think about how it was (and still is) a tool for thought and an
instrument of emotional understanding. The course covers a broad range of major
works as well as less commonly-read (yet indelibly great) poetry—especially
poetry by women. Shakespeare, Spenser, and Donne will take their place in
context alongside poets like Isabella Whitney, Mary Wroth, Katherine Philips,
George Herbert, and Amelia Lanyer. This is a pre-1800 Literature course

burgeoning social sciences and the “linguistic turn.” After exploring the
varieties of modernism in American literature, we will attempt to characterize
the postmodern: Is postmodernism a break with modernism or an accentuation of
elements latent in modernism itself? Is it a cultural mood, a structural
feature of late capitalism, or a programmatic literary mode? Throughout the

borrowed or appropriated? Can one memory be used to lend public visibility to
another? This course explores the possibilities and limits of relating different
histories of injustice through narratives and theories in and around the
aftermath of the Holocaust. Scholarship on “multidirectional memories” has
recently emphasized the varied new perspectives on history to be gained from
reading memories with respect to their intersectional potential. If we
understand memory as a medium for “negotiation, cross-referencing, and
borrowing,” Michael Rothberg argues, we can see different traumatic pasts as
“productive” for the ways they shape our thinking of the present. In this way,
James Baldwin utilized the German past for a play on the construction of
Blackness. The German Jewish exile Charlotte Beradt
wrote radio reportages on Black political figures that connected scenes of
Weimar Germany with anti-racist struggles in America. And the German filmmaker
Harun Farocki created montages that layered memories
of National Socialism with colonial echoes and contemporary political events
such as the Vietnam War. In their work, and in the projects of other
transatlantic writers and artists, the permeability of memory as a traveling
medium, hidden cargo, and volatile stray substance
becomes visible. This course will provide students with a perspective of the
postwar moment as a moment of profound exploratory thinking on the politics of
relational memory. We will read a number of philosophical and theoretical texts
on memory and engage these in conversation with postwar literary texts and
films from Europe and the US.","100 and 200 Level Classes","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/lit2courses.html"

Why aren't there more
women in leadership positions? According to a 2018 Pew Research Center report,
the majority of American men and women acknowledge the capacity of women to
lead. Yet in certain domains--most notably politics and business-- continue
to be under-represented at the top and the American public remains
skeptical that gender parity can be achieved.  Recent elections have
galvanized the electorate around constructions of gender in particularly
dramatic ways.  If we are living in a post-feminist society (as some
claim), why do these questions and conflicts continue to arise? Identity is an
urgent conversation in 21st-century politics and everyday life, and this
includes awareness of how intersectionality shapes gendered experiences. What
are the stories that we tell ourselves and each other about equality,
representation, privilege, freedom, authority, and success? How do these
inflect real-world outcomes for individuals and societies?  In this
two-credit course we will explore some of the stories that circulate in our
culture around women and power, both from an academic and from a practical,
real-world perspective. What does it mean to lead? How do we use a language of
empowerment? Why has the United States embraced certain narratives of gender
equity and success as opposed to those being created in other countries and
cultures? We will focus on learning from women who are committed to making a
difference in the world through their personal and professional choices,
hearing their stories, and reading texts that have been particularly important
to them in their lives and work. So too, we will engage with stories from the

the sonnet: rule-bound, artificial, and old-fashioned. The funny thing is, the
poets writing in the English Renaissance tried everything they could to make
their poems appear as just the opposite: organic, sincere, and excitingly new.
When they realized that their experiments were failures, they also came to see
the failures as interesting in new ways. What resulted was a period of wild and
flourishing literary inventiveness. Beginning with the reign of Queen Elizabeth
I and ending around the tumultuous English Civil Wars and the regicide of King
Charles I, the century spanning 1550 to 1650 in English history was responsible
for grand upheavals in culture, religion, politics, and science. Accordingly,
just beneath the veneer of formal qualities like rhyme and meter, poems from
the period are sensitive and probing explorations of chaos, frustration,
madness, desire, and the sublime. By focusing on experiences of error,
uncertainty, shame, and failure, this course examines how Renaissance poets
fought with language as they tried to say things that they did not know how to
say. Through both critical and creative exercises, students will develop an
approach to writing unafraid of failure and emboldened by experiences of
risk-taking. We’ll hone a deep understanding of essential aspects of poetry
while we think about how it was (and still is) a tool for thought and an
instrument of emotional understanding. The course covers a broad range of major
works as well as less commonly-read (yet indelibly great) poetry—especially
poetry by women. Shakespeare, Spenser, and Donne will take their place in
context alongside poets like Isabella Whitney, Mary Wroth, Katherine Philips,
George Herbert, and Amelia Lanyer. This is a pre-1800 Literature course

one of the country’s most storied cities since the end of World War II. It
claims its indispensable nature for the political and symbolic order while
breaking away from the rhetoric of continuity and the centralized or unified
notion of the metropolis. Rather than investigating Tokyo through the lenses of
urban studies, we will examine depictions of contemporary lives (e.g., family,
work, campus life, and love) in Tokyo by delving into a collection of short
stories, novels, and films set in and around the city. We will read fiction by
writers such as Abe Kōbō, Yoshimoto Banana, Kawakami Hiromi, Tsushima Yūko,
Ogawa Yōko, Yū Miri, Kirino Natsuo, and Murakami Haruki and examine films by
directors such as Ozu Yasujirō, Kurosawa Akira, Kurosawa Kiyoshi, Naruse Mikio
and Koreeda Hirokazu. Course themes will include the changing nature of city
life, the disintegration of the family, narrative techniques in fiction and
film, the development of hyper-modern consumer culture, questions of cultural
and personal memory, the shift of gender ideologies, and the representation of
marginalized groups in urban spaces. The objective of this course is to

borrowed or appropriated? Can one memory be used to lend public visibility to
another? This course explores the possibilities and limits of relating
different histories of injustice through narratives and theories in and around
the aftermath of the Holocaust. Scholarship on “multidirectional memories” has
recently emphasized the varied new perspectives on history to be gained from
reading memories with respect to their intersectional potential. If we understand
memory as a medium for “negotiation, cross-referencing, and borrowing,” Michael
Rothberg argues, we can see different traumatic pasts as “productive” for the
ways they shape our thinking of the present. In this way, James Baldwin
utilized the German past for a play on the construction of Blackness. The
German Jewish exile Charlotte Beradt wrote radio
reportages on Black political figures that connected scenes of Weimar Germany
with anti-racist struggles in America. And the German filmmaker Harun Farocki created montages that layered memories of National
Socialism with colonial echoes and contemporary political events such as the
Vietnam War. In their work, and in the projects of other transatlantic writers
and artists, the permeability of memory as a traveling medium, hidden cargo,
and volatile stray substance
becomes visible. This course will provide students with a perspective of the
postwar moment as a moment of profound exploratory thinking on the politics of relational

is the great idol of our age.  It
divorces leisure from labor and turns life into a series of utilitarian dead
ends.  Conversely, the impulse to play,
to engage in gratuitous moments of being, in seemingly evanescent
conversations, might be our only chance to convert specialized knowledge into
self-knowledge. Since Socrates, conversation has been admired for its seemless ability
to perform thinking, to integrate knowledge into society, and to supplement
savoir (knowledge) with savoir-vivre (the art of living).  But conversation, precisely because it
clashes with the useful, has often been condemned as merely artful, dangerous
for its proximity to the decadent and the idle.   But what is so threatening about
idleness?  According to Nietzsche,
because idleness leads to self-reflection, we avoid it by mindlessly embracing
work.  The work ethic has become an
excuse for not thinking about the desperate human condition.. Paradoxically,
work has become an escapist diversion and the time to rest and to converse
has  being usurped by the false plenitude
of mechanical labor.  Proust’s In Search
of Lost Time adds a new twist to this dichotomy: for the social-climber,
conversation becomes work, a laborious exercise in appearing rather than
being.   This course examines how these
tensions are played both on a rhetorical 
(we will read diverse narratological studies on conversation, studying
the use of silences, repetition, dialogue, etc.) and on a thematic level.  After reading a selection of critiques of
'pure' work (Aristotle, Schiller, Marx, and Nietzsche), we will examine texts  that expose the vanity of conversation

popular Enlightenment ideology suggested Americans could control their own
destinies, making and remaking their characters, and even their bodies, at
will. What ideas emerged here about the kind of self one should make, and the
kinds of bodies that should be discarded? How were those ideas proffered in and
shaped by literary imaginings? How have they persisted and changed over time,
especially in relation to ideas about American identity? Our reading list takes
us into the present day, and includes an introduction to the major questions

Leo Tolstoy's epic War and Peace – built around these formidable

eroticism of Nabokov’s masterwork not only as a matter of plot,

aesthetics of sexual desire for Nabokov is inseparable from language – a
physiological, cognitive, and symbolic medium that can affect the reader both
on the level of sound (alliteration, friction, tension, etc.) as well as
through figurative speech, with its multiplicity of connotations and allusions
(hidden messages are like taboos: we desire to break them). Lolita, the novel

Nabokov acquired and adopted, rather than being born into. We will investigate
the impact Nabokov’s complicated relationship with the language had on his
writing techniques and stylistic choices. We will also explore strategies of
narrative concealment Nabokov used in order to seduce, mislead, and even
morally blind his readers. Among the texts offered for study and discussion,

their tales within the metaphoric landscapes of ruined abbeys and diabolic

contemporized tropes, settings, and narrative strategies to create a new era in
this tradition. Identified as the New Gothic, this phase appears to have risen
in tandem with a parallel literary phenomenon, termed by speculative fiction

genres of the fantastic, fabular, and horror in a similar groundbreaking

the sonnet: rule-bound, artificial, and old-fashioned. The funny thing is, the
poets writing in the English Renaissance tried everything they could to make
their poems appear as just the opposite: organic, sincere, and excitingly new.
When they realized that their experiments were failures, they also came to see
the failures as interesting in new ways. What resulted was a period of wild and
flourishing literary inventiveness. Beginning with the reign of Queen Elizabeth
I and ending around the tumultuous English Civil Wars and the regicide of King
Charles I, the century spanning 1550 to 1650 in English history was responsible
for grand upheavals in culture, religion, politics, and science. Accordingly,
just beneath the veneer of formal qualities like rhyme and meter, poems from
the period are sensitive and probing explorations of chaos, frustration,
madness, desire, and the sublime. By focusing on experiences of error,
uncertainty, shame, and failure, this course examines how Renaissance poets
fought with language as they tried to say things that they did not know how to
say. Through both critical and creative exercises, students will develop an
approach to writing unafraid of failure and emboldened by experiences of
risk-taking. We’ll hone a deep understanding of essential aspects of poetry
while we think about how it was (and still is) a tool for thought and an
instrument of emotional understanding. The course covers a broad range of major
works as well as less commonly-read (yet indelibly great) poetry—especially
poetry by women. Shakespeare, Spenser, and Donne will take their place in
context alongside poets like Isabella Whitney, Mary Wroth, Katherine Philips,
George Herbert, and Amelia Lanyer. This is a pre-1800 Literature course

arc that extends from Greek and Roman epic poetry to the early Christian
rewriting of heroic narrative; from the famous letters between a Parisian
philosopher and his brilliant (female) student to the enchanted ships, fairy
ladies, and allegorical gardens of medieval romance; and from Dante Alighieri’s
magnificent synthesis of pagan and Christian systems of thought to Renaissance
humanists’ recourse to classical models as a way to make sense of their own
world. Far from a fixed canon of great works, European literature has always
been a fluid collection of writings, constantly in the process of being
rethought by its own makers. Texts to be read include Homer’s Odyssey (in
part), Virgil’s Aeneid, Augustine’s Confessions, The Letters of Abelard and
Heloise, Marie de France’s Lays, The Romance of the Rose, Dante’s Inferno and
Purgatorio, Petrarch’s sonnets, letters, and dialogues, and Desiderius
Erasmus’s The Praise of Folly. While students are encouraged to take both
semesters of Rethinking European Literature, they are also free to sign up for
just one semester. This is a pre-1800 Literature course offering.","Literature","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/literature.html"

England’s first printing press at Westminster in London. Prior to this technological
innovation (which the sixteenth-century writer John Foxe deemed miraculous),
books were made from vellum (animal skin) and were written and illuminated—or
painted—by hand. In this course, we’ll study medieval English manuscript-books
as both cultural objects and literary artifacts, dividing our time between
learning how manuscripts were imagined and constructed before the invention of
the printing press, and reading them. For us, “reading” will mean engaging in
literary and visual analysis of our texts—including epics, lyrics, myths, and
romances, all of which will be made available in modern printed editions—as
well as learning to decipher the handwriting of scribes responsible for copying
our texts. Our work will raise questions about literacy and its definitions;
literary labor; the history of the book; the development and preservation of
literary and visual artifacts; the relationship between image and text; the
ethical and practical problems of producing modern printed editions of handwritten
texts; and the proximity of anonymous pre-print culture to the so-called
Internet Age. We will also gain some hands-on experience with manuscripts via
the College’s recently acquired raw manuscript materials, medieval manuscript
leaves, and manuscript facsimiles. This is a pre-1800 Literature course

  Studies","null","null","null","null","The Useful, Schiller wrote in The Aesthetic Education of Man,
is the great idol of our age.  It
divorces leisure from labor and turns life into a series of utilitarian dead
ends.  Conversely, the impulse to play,
to engage in gratuitous moments of being, in seemingly evanescent
conversations, might be our only chance to convert specialized knowledge into
self-knowledge. Since Socrates, conversation has been admired for its seemless
ability to perform thinking, to integrate knowledge into society, and to
supplement savoir (knowledge) with savoir-vivre (the art of living).  But conversation, precisely because it
clashes with the useful, has often been condemned as merely artful, dangerous
for its proximity to the decadent and the idle.   But what is so threatening about
idleness?  According to Nietzsche,
because idleness leads to self-reflection, we avoid it by mindlessly embracing
work.  The work ethic has become an
excuse for not thinking about the desperate human condition.. Paradoxically,
work has become an escapist diversion and the time to rest and to converse
has  being usurped by the false plenitude
of mechanical labor.  Proust’s In Search of Lost Time adds a new twist to this dichotomy:
for the social-climber, conversation becomes work, a laborious exercise in
appearing rather than being.   This
course examines how these tensions are played both on a rhetorical  (we will read diverse narratological studies
on conversation, studying the use of silences, repetition, dialogue, etc.) and
on a thematic level.  After reading a
selection of critiques of ‘pure’ work (Aristotle, Schiller, Marx, and
Nietzsche), we will examine texts  that
expose the vanity of conversation (Pascal’s Pensées, Molière’s
Misanthrope),  novels that thematize the
tensions between work and conversation as social and cultural phenomena  (Henry James, The Europeans, Updike Rabbit
Run), and works that offer up possible aesthetic theories of conversation
(Proust, Swann’s Way and Against Sainte Beuve). 
We will also scrutinize instances where conversation becomes a mere
filler (Beckett’s Waiting for Godot). 
Students will also read Paul Lafargue’s In Praise of Idleness and
Corinne Maier’s Laziness, the recent French bestseller attacking the
dangers of work. This course is a Literature Junior Seminar course.","Literature","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/literature.html"

eroticism of Nabokov’s masterwork not only as a matter of plot,
characterization, or dialogue, but also as a linguistic phenomenon. The
aesthetics of sexual desire for Nabokov is inseparable from language – a
physiological, cognitive, and symbolic medium that can affect the reader both
on the level of sound (alliteration, friction, tension, etc.) as well as
through figurative speech, with its multiplicity of connotations and allusions
(hidden messages are like taboos: we desire to break them). Lolita, the novel
we will be reading and re-reading in class, was written in English, which
Nabokov acquired and adopted, rather than being born into. We will investigate
the impact Nabokov’s complicated relationship with the language had on his
writing techniques and stylistic choices. We will also explore strategies of
narrative concealment Nabokov used in order to seduce, mislead, and even
morally blind his readers. Among the texts offered for study and discussion,
there will be Lolita’s prototexts, such as fairy-tales and Arthurian legends;
works by William Shakespeare, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Edgar Allan Poe,
Lewis Carroll, and John Ruskin; Russian classical literature (Fyodor
Dostoevsky, Leo Tostoy, Anton Chekhov); German, French, and American pulp
fiction; and the author’s own novels and short stories, either written in
English (Bend Sinister, “A Fairy-Tale”, “Colette”) or self-translated from the
Russian (Laughter in the Dark). This course is a Literature Junior Seminar
course.","Literature","https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/literature.html"
