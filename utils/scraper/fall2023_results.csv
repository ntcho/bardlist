Alongside primary materials, including memoirs, course texts will include fiction and scholarly works. Students will learn research skills as they prepare a seminar paper based on primary sources and historiographical analysis. Students will be reading colonial documents ‘against the grain,’ as well as seeing how metropolitan-established boarding schools affected indigenous populations on two (or more) continents.

LIT 3048,"Extraordinary Bodies: Disability in American Literature and Culture","Jaime Alves",4,10,Tue, 18:00, 21:00, "Olin 305",,,,,"LA, D+J","Human Rights","","In this course, we will examine U.S. fiction, non-fiction, poetry, and memoir to understand how writers of the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries represent the “normal” body, as well as a constellation of bodies presented as extraordinary: bodies that differ from the average at birth or are transformed by illness or war; bodies paraded as “freaks”; bodies that don’t fit into established categories. We begin in the early nineteenth century, when popular Enlightenment ideology suggested Americans could control their own destinies, making and remaking their characters, and even their bodies, at will. What ideas emerged here about the kind of self one should make, and the kinds of bodies that should be discarded? How were those ideas proffered in and shaped by literary imaginings? How have they persisted and changed over time, especially in relation to ideas about American identity? Our reading list takes us into the present day, and includes an introduction to the major questions and scholarly perspectives under debate at the intersection of Disability Studies and the study of literature. We also work with critical, theoretical, and historical texts on disability as an intersectional identity requiring intentional and sustained examination in order to bring into being a more just and inclusive society.

Specifically, the course will focus on the history of disability in the American education system, including a brief history of the disability rights movement, historical perspectives, advocacy initiatives (such as Conventions on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD; Disability Rights, Education, Activism, and Mentoring, DREAM, etc.), and the legal framework (the access it provides and the limitations it produces). Differences between the medical model and social model of disability, and institutionalization and deinstitutionalization will be discussed and examined in the context of educational settings. Disability, as it relates to education, will be examined from both a civil rights and human rights perspective. The course will consider the following questions: What is ableism and how does it appear in education? What is a disability from historical, legal, and humanistic perspectives? What does it mean to be disabled in America? What does access in educational settings for disabled students mean? What are the laws that contribute to access (ADA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, IDEA, Fair Housing Act, etc.)? What are educational modifications and “reasonable accommodations?” Students will learn to think critically about disability in a variety of contexts and have a greater understanding of the complexities surrounding disability in education. Students will also develop a deeper understanding of exclusionary and inclusionary educational practices as well as inaccessible and accessible educational environments for disabled people.",92446,Bard BA/MAT 4 + 1 Program,https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/mat.htm

Guided by readings in education, we will consider the inter-personal, cultural, social and ethical issues that arise in the context of civic engagement in schools. In particular, we will consider: What are our personal and professional aspirations as teachers, tutors, mentors and leaders? What systemic or other changes might we like to see in our civic engagement and how might we best go about making or advocating for them? How can we improve our own communication skills so that we become better and more skillful presenters, listeners and responders? What are the potential challenges we may face in supporting someone’s learning? Throughout this course we will emphasize writing as a means of engaging with content, and we will workshop and critique problems that you may experience and encounter in your outreach work.

According to a 2018 Pew Research Center report, the majority of American men and women acknowledge the capacity of women to lead. Yet in certain domains--most notably politics and business-- continue to be under-represented at the top and the American public remains skeptical that gender parity can be achieved. Recent elections have galvanized the electorate around constructions of gender in particularly dramatic ways. If we are living in a post-feminist society (as some claim), why do these questions and conflicts continue to arise? Identity is an urgent conversation in 21st-century politics and everyday life, and this includes awareness of how intersectionality shapes gendered experiences. What are the stories that we tell ourselves and each other about equality, representation, privilege, freedom, authority, and success? How do these inflect real-world outcomes for individuals and societies? In this two-credit course we will explore some of the stories that circulate in our culture around women and power, both from an academic and from a practical, real-world perspective. What does it mean to lead? How do we use a language of empowerment? Why has the United States embraced certain narratives of gender equity and success as opposed to those being created in other countries and cultures? We will focus on learning from women who are committed to making a difference in the world through their personal and professional choices, hearing their stories, and reading texts that have been particularly important to them in their lives and work. So too, we will engage with stories from the past (archival research), from across disciplines (government, politics, the military, higher education, STEM, the arts, tech, media) and from a wide range of perspectives. As an Engaged Liberal Arts and Sciences course, this seminar will provide students with the unique opportunity to bring theory and practice together in a very immediate sense: by the end of the term you will have identified a story only you can tell, whether it is based in political activism, community engagement, or work experience. Drawing on the rich resources here in Annandale as well as through Bard's other campuses we will reach out to groups and organizations with a shared focus on gender. Network building is something we will explicitly address. This course is open to all first-year students.

At once the product of local land and long-distance transactions, natural dyes help us navigate and rethink the boundaries and connections between local and global, indigenous and foreign, and permanent and transitory. Drawing upon dye plants currently growing in and around the Bard campus, including indigo, madder, sumac, goldenrod, safflower, and marigold, we will examine how natural dyes initiated cultural transformations, scientific developments, and human interactions with the natural world in their rooted and mobile states.

The course will also explore the circumstances and fallout when creatives have pushed the line to pirate the property of others with activism, ambivalence, or hedonism at the helm. Through historical analysis, students will be asked to think critically about developing their own personal ethics for creative production, mapping how to responsibly incorporate existing work into their own.

By reading a number of scholars with widely varying views, including Hannah Arendt, Yehuda Bauer, and Isaiah Trunk, we will grapple with the issues raised on several levels: Theoretically, what are the most useful definitions of these terms?

Is it an inextricable element of global political life? What would a world without war look like? Can we even imagine it? Global politics is largely predicated on the idea that war is an inescapable feature of our international political system. While it must be managed lest it have devastating effects, it remains a vital element of our collective international system—a political system that many find acceptable and desirable, despite the death and destruction it can cause. While the past few years have seen a rise in (inter)national discussions of abolitionist politics centering on carceral politics, policing, and nuclear weapons, there has not been a similarly high profile move regarding war abolition. The early 20th century saw the flourishing of anti-war movements whose activism for peace included efforts to outlaw war entirely, most famously codified in the 1928 Kellogg-Briand Pact prohibiting war. This class will use abolitionist politics in other contemporary contexts—e.g. anti-nuclear, anti-prison, and anti-police movements—as a lens for investigating war abolition. It will also explore pacifist theory and practice, nonviolence, as well as critical theoretical approaches toward war and sovereignty.

We will explore the role that psychiatry has played in defining and shaping what has been considered ‘normal female’ as opposed to ‘normal male’ behavior. The course begins with the history of conceptualizing the ‘female madness’ starting from the witchcraft persecution in Europe to the emergence of diagnostic categories such as “neurasthenia’ and ‘hysteria’ which were frequently applied to women in the 19 th and early 20 th centuries. We will discuss biological explanations used to explain mental disorder in women and associated psychiatric practices of the past. The key point of the course is to look at how gender roles and stereotypes may have contributed to definitions of mental illness with varied impacts on women and men. For example, we will read materials about how women who deviated from their ascribed gender roles were continuously likely to be categorized as ‘insane’. In the second part of the course, our focus will be on how diagnoses have changed over time and the modern day gender biases still found in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).

From elections to education, ambition (or its absence) has become for many of us a defining feature of life in the twenty-first century—the quest to do more, better, faster. Where does ambition come from? How should we think about it? And what can we do about it? In 2015, Reese Witherspoon declared “ambition is not a dirty word,” but she is just one of the latest in a long line of thinkers, writers, poets, and scholars who have considered ambition and its discontents. This course brings together authors from ancient Greece, India, Rome, and the more recent world—from Augustine to Spinoza, from the Buddha to Sophocles—who grappled with the ambiguities and complexities of ambition. In the classical Indian tradition, Heroic hymns celebrate the impulse to power, scholastic treatises theorize it in detail, and court poetry adorns it. When fame no longer serves as goad or goal, ambition and power are subsumed within a discourse of duty (dharma). In the ancient Greek Iliad, Achilles wants to be the “best of the Achaeans” and to be celebrated in song. And for the Romans, ambition was always a delicate balance: act with too little, and one risked sinking the family name; too much, and you might be labeled a social parasite, or worse, a sociopathic tyrant. To this equation, the introduction of Christianity to the Roman world only added complicating factors. Gospel mandates to strive for perfect holiness changed the game and raised the stakes of ambition—heaven was now on the line. At the same time, they paradoxically commanded the most ambitious Christians to be utterly meek. But there is also a rich tradition of discordant voices that challenge the dominant, ambitious tone: Buddhist and Jain ascetics standing next to mythic figures from the epics; ordinary devotees amidst the prophets of the past; Romans, who wrote obsessively in efforts to resolve the conflicting social pressures of ambition—to be at once ruthlessly competitive and yet also responsible to hierarchy and decorum; Aristotle and the quiet virtues of being good enough. How might this unlikely chorus displace or denature the ego, the seat of ambition? And how do we envision ethical action in a universe that no longer revolves around the individual agent? Could one be both a humble servant—whether to gods, God, or the State—and a superstar?",92181,The Common Courses,https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/commoncourses.htm

This tragic moment of reflection raises a number of bedeviling questions. How do we narrate a decolonial history of Ukraine? Is it possible, or desirable, to disentangle Ukrainian culture from empires of the past and present? Can we imagine a future political and economic order for Ukraine that is not wholly dependent upon more powerful global and regional actors? This course juxtaposes the arguments of influential decolonial theorists against case studies in Ukrainian history, culture, and political economy. Students will gain exposure to texts written by African, Indian, South American, Middle Eastern, North American Indigenous, and Eastern European thinkers on the subject of decolonization. In parallel, we will study key Ukrainian artistic, political, and social movements from queer decolonial activism to calls to redefine the canon of classical music, art history, literature, and cinema. We consider debates about “decommunization,” the racialized dynamics of migration, and what it means to call oneself Ukrainian after 2022.

Topics will range from the development of new techniques of propaganda and military oversight to the manipulation of social technologies such as identification papers, the census, racial pseudo-science, and, most horrifically, the concentration camp system. At the end of the Nazi period, the DDR defined itself through its resistance to the Nazi party, and nearly the entirety of its ideology was grounded in anti-Fascism and cosmopolitanism. The means of organizing and controlling society were often directly carried over from the Nazi past. Similarly, the liberal capitalist ideology of the BRD defined itself in complete opposition to the Nazi past, but here as well there were surprising number holdovers from the Nazi era, ranging from the system of registering with the police to the retention of leading bureaucrats. By comparing the two movements, ideologically complete opposites yet organizationally often surprisingly similar, we can address some of the most disturbing issues of modern techniques of social control. Similarly, protests within each system against specific moments of state power – ranging from issues such as the use of the census and identity cards to methods of police surveillance and conscription – were frequently couched in terms of their links with the Nazi era.

The seminar will then explore the simultaneous rise of wars and conflicts over radically different religious meanings and faiths, within and outside of Catholicism, including native religions and the rise of Evangelical Protestant Christianity. The latter part of the seminar will focus on Guatemala, which dramatically combined extreme violence over race, religion, and revolution, and focused global attention on indigenous rights and human rights. These histories will allow for a deeper understanding of the rise of different forms of violence in Central America today, and therefore of the current human rights, migrant, and refugee crisis centered there and involving other parts of Latin America and the US. This seminar emphasizes the narratives, interpretations, and voices of participants in the history, and critical engagement with these primary sources in the writing of the history.

This course introduces students to sociological approaches to race and ethnicity. We will examine race as a socially constructed category by engaging with multiple sociological theories and accounts of contemporary racial problems. We will answer questions such as, what is meant when we say race is socially constructed and not biological? What are the sociohistorical processes that have cemented racial stratification? And how does the lived experience of being racialized intersect with other social categories such as gender, immigration status, and socioeconomic class? Together, we will also tackle the task of defining, deconstructing, and connecting concepts such as racism, discrimination, anti-Blackness, and intersectionality.

Notwithstanding the common misperception of a single Jewish ethnicity, Judaism presents us with a fascinating test-case of a distinct, even parochial, tradition that constantly takes up new shape and color while maintaining a “family resemblance” with parallel expressions of Judaism. This course introduces students to some of the foundational practices, ideas, and expressions of Judaism while grappling both with its inner diversity, as well as its sense of coherence.

They can do this to correct injustices, show mercy, or undo disproportionate punishments. Clemency doesn’t just happen – it requires a lot of work on the part of the incarcerated person and his or her advocates. But there are almost no rules governing what a clemency appeal looks like, so there is significant room for creativity in how applicants present their cases. In this practical seminar we will join forces with a team of students at CUNY Law School and the human rights organization WITNESS to prepare short video presentations that will accompany a number of New York State clemency applications this fall. Proficiency with video shooting, editing, and an independent work ethic are important. Meetings with clemency applicants in prison are a central element of the class. This is an opportunity to work collaboratively with law students and faculty, to do hands-on human rights research and advocacy, and to create work that has real-life impact. The class will alternate between video production and the study of clemency and pardons, emotion and human rights, first-person narrative, and persuasion by visual means. Please submit a short statement describing your abilities in shooting and editing video, and your interest in criminal justice, by May 6th.

LIT 144,"Failing with Style: Introduction to Renaissance Poetry","Adhaar Desai",4,22,Tue Thurs, 13:30, 14:50, "Olin 205",,,,,"LA","","","When we think about Renaissance poetry, we tend to think of the sonnet: rule-bound, artificial, and old-fashioned. The funny thing is, the poets writing in the English Renaissance tried everything they could to make their poems appear as just the opposite: organic, sincere, and excitingly new. When they realized that their experiments were failures, they also came to see the failures as interesting in new ways. What resulted was a period of wild and flourishing literary inventiveness. Beginning with the reign of Queen Elizabeth I and ending around the tumultuous English Civil Wars and the regicide of King Charles I, the century spanning 1550 to 1650 in English history was responsible for grand upheavals in culture, religion, politics, and science. Accordingly, just beneath the veneer of formal qualities like rhyme and meter, poems from the period are sensitive and probing explorations of chaos, frustration, madness, desire, and the sublime. By focusing on experiences of error, uncertainty, shame, and failure, this course examines how Renaissance poets fought with language as they tried to say things that they did not know how to say. Through both critical and creative exercises, students will develop an approach to writing unafraid of failure and emboldened by experiences of risk-taking. We’ll hone a deep understanding of essential aspects of poetry while we think about how it was (and still is) a tool for thought and an instrument of emotional understanding. The course covers a broad range of major works as well as less commonly-read (yet indelibly great) poetry—especially poetry by women. Shakespeare, Spenser, and Donne will take their place in context alongside poets like Isabella Whitney, Mary Wroth, Katherine Philips, George Herbert, and Amelia Lanyer.

This happens despite our knowing that characters remain exactly what their name implies: trapped by printed letters, scriptedness, or the limits of a screen. Characters are always mediated, but they can also show us how concepts like humanity and personhood depend on and contend with the media humans use to share ideas. In this course, we will study the history of characters in western fiction to learn how archetypes, racial and gendered stereotypes, historical or geographical settings, and the capabilities of different media technologies shape our encounters with them. We will also explore different ways of “reading“ characters by thinking about how computer algorithms might understand something as supposedly complex as an individual's personality. Primary texts will include Shakespeare's Hamlet, Stevenson’s Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde, Parks’s The America Play, Cusk’s Outline, and short stories by Toni Morrison, Kate Chopin, and others.

What does it mean to write about American culture? What is culture? What is America, for that matter? What might it mean to “study” America’s cultural products, aesthetics, and history, and how can we translate our experiences of these into critical argument or reflection?

The Nile, one of the world’s longest rivers, rises in Eastern Africa and flows through the region for most of its course to Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Between them, the Rift Valley and the Nile river transect a region of spectacular ecological and cultural diversity, embracing modes of human existence that range from pastoral nomadism to the lives of modern city-dwellers. It spans the whole of human history: fossil evidence indicates that the Rift was where the emergence of modern humans took place, approximately 200,000 years ago. In the present day, following waves of globalisation, the lands of the Rift and those of the Nile Basin have come to exemplify the difficulties that confront much of modern Africa. These include the legacy of colonialism and anti-colonial struggle, civil war, the unrestrained exploitation of natural resources, population pressure, and accelerating environmental change. These processes have led to growing levels of urbanization, displacement and forced migration. The response of communities in the region demonstrates the inventiveness of human adaptation and the drama of survival.

At the doors of India, numerous nomads, warriors, and conquerors turned into dust on the battlefield or became one with the people, thus making Delhi the proverbial heart of India. On the other hand, Mumbai, previously known as Bombay, emerged as a sprawling port city during the British colonial era.

This course explores the role of popular representations of police in film, television (narrative and reality) video games and graphic novels–what we’ll call copaganda–in keeping abolitionist forces at bay within the nation’s political imaginary. We’ll follow a series of periods when American police and policing faced crises of legitimacy–the post-prohibition era, the radial social movements of the 1960s, the child safety crisis of the 1980s and the post 9/11/War on Terror decade–and explore the popular media forms that emerged to naturalize police as essential to social order including: the procedural, the police sit-com, the “female cop drama,” “anti-hero” cop shows like NYPD Blue, science fiction dramas such as Battlestar Galactica and high-action cop soap operas such as 24.

Although the myth of Rome and its imperial past fostered literati’s dreams of political grandeur, Italy grounds its multifold identity on the difference and peculiarities of cities such as Florence, Venice, Naples, Trieste and Milan. Living, walking, and imagining the city is a key experience for Italian culture, from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance, to the Postmodern. With a multidisciplinary approach from poetry to visual arts, the course draws from the works of authors such as Dante, Boccaccio, Machiavelli, the Futurists, Calvino and Elena Ferrante.

As the epicenter of publishing and filmmaking in Japan, Tokyo has been one of the country’s most storied cities since the end of World War II. It claims its indispensable nature for the political and symbolic order while breaking away from the rhetoric of continuity and the centralized or unified notion of the metropolis. Rather than investigating Tokyo through the lenses of urban studies, we will examine depictions of contemporary lives (e.g., family, work, campus life, and love) in Tokyo by delving into a collection of short stories, novels, and films set in and around the city. We will read fiction by writers such as Abe Kōbō, Yoshimoto Banana, Kawakami Hiromi, Tsushima Yūko, Ogawa Yōko, Yū Miri, Kirino Natsuo, and Murakami Haruki and examine films by directors such as Ozu Yasujirō, Kurosawa Akira, Kurosawa Kiyoshi, Naruse Mikio and Koreeda Hirokazu. Course themes will include the changing nature of city life, the disintegration of the family, narrative techniques in fiction and film, the development of hyper-modern consumer culture, questions of cultural and personal memory, the shift of gender ideologies, and the representation of marginalized groups in urban spaces. The objective of this course is to reevaluate recent Japanese literary and cinematic works set in Tokyo using various approaches and angles to consider how the experience of the city shapes our reading and viewing of the works.

Physical and imaginative immersion in the wild provided late 18th- and 19th-century writers with methods for engaging the natural environment that directly resisted instrumentalization and anthropocentrism. By developing practices for direct perception of and communication with the non-human world, these writers simultaneously reactivated ancient ways of knowing and contested dominant Enlightenment paradigms that privilege thinking over feeling, reason over sensation, and activity over receptivity. We will read extensively from the works of Goethe, P.B. Shelley, and Thoreau. Other key Romantic-era writers to be explored include Schelling, Blake, Darwin, and Emerson.

Our readings will cover key traditions in critical political economy from a variety of perspectives, including Marxism and post-Marxism, feminism, Black radical thought, postcolonialism, environmentalism, prison abolitionism, and utopian socialism, among others. Our analysis of critical political economy has two broader aims: first, to analyze the historical question of how and why capitalism became the dominant form of economic organization in the modern world; and second, to examine theoretical critiques of the political, social, cultural, and economic implications of capitalism’s triumph over competing systems. To this end, we will study the central perspectives and problems that continue to inform contemporary critiques of capitalist societies the world over, from cobalt mines in the Congo to high-tech startups in Silicon Valley.

In this course we interrogate and complicate these kinds of platitudes, examining claims about the nature and possibilities of travel in its many iterations. Throughout the semester, we ask why people travel, what might be gained or lost by traveling, what is unique to the experience of travel, and, ultimately, whether or not we should travel. We draw from memoir, fiction, film, and contemporary journalism as we consider claims about the effects of travel on travelers, non-travelers, local communities, and the world at large. We think about links between conceptions of travel and broader historical and social structures, considering the histories of class-exclusive travel, ways that colonialism has shaped travel, and the ethics of travel with respect to its impact on both local communities and the environment. Central to our inquiry is an examination of claims about both the religious value or potential of travel – including those found in accounts of pilgrimages and monastic journeys – and the ways that travel can often become linked to ideas of the “spiritual.”",92079,Environmental Studies,https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/es.htm

Not only did they transform the states of the Latin West, Byzantium, and the Islamic Near East, but the fostered changes in politics, culture, literature, belief, and devotional practices from Britain to Persia—as well as providing a set of symbols and narratives that continue to resonate even in the 21st century. The Crusades may be gone, but they are hardly forgotten. Though often conceptualized as a clash between Christian and Muslim civilizations, this course challenges that view with a pluralist approach, showing students how crusading warfare and beliefs were also deployed against pagans and indigenous people on Europe’s frontiers, heterodox Christians, and a range of political opponents. More than a history of warfare, this course examines intellectual, institutional, and financial innovations that shaped crusading in the Middle Ages, as well as the ways it was exported to a globally connected world from the 15th century onward. Ranging from the 7th century CE to modern America, this course traces the long arc of crusading: from church councils and popular campaigns of the High Middle Ages, through the emergence of the Ottomans and their conquest of the eastern Mediterranean, and into modern appropriations of crusading in service of imperialism, nationalism, terrorism, and neofascist politics. Along the way, we will encounter not only zealous preachers and reluctant soldiers, but also crafty politicians and simple believers, pirates and princes. The course then intersects with histories of the Mediterranean, the Latin Middle Ages and Byzantium, the Islamic Near East, the early modern world, and even modern politics.

Between the mid-nineteenth and early-twentieth century, most of the Ottoman Empire’s Arab provinces came under British and French colonial rule. Colonizers deemed the ‘Oriental’ male body weak, insufficiently masculine and unfit for national service, while the female body was exoticized and hypersexualized. During the same period, many local governments struggled with foreign debt, and, consequently, took interest in their populations as a source of labor power to be exploited. The following decades saw the proliferation of discourse on sports, labor, chastity, honor, prostitution, and drug addiction. It also saw the rise of new institutions, including prisons, families, sports clubs, and police agencies, as sites of contestation between the colonizer and the colonized. Throughout the course, we will scrutinize the proliferation of this discourse on ‘Oriental bodies’. We will also explore the role of these emergent institutions in the gendering bodies, exploiting labor, and organizing collective life.

Through unpacking these concepts, their aspirations, and shortcomings, the course allows students to work through some recent controversies of religious conflict and cases where conflicts are managed better. The course ends by looking at dialogue to ask if, indeed, the modern world allows for inter and intra-religious dialogue, who initiates and engages in it, and how to assess the ethical framework within which this task is undertaken towards goals of building understanding and mutuality through religion for the self and community.",92116,Middle Eastern Studies,https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/middleeast.htm

The first track (first meetings of the week) focuses on the history of human rights advocacy. It is anchored in developing a chronology and typology for making claims to humanity and/or human rights as well as denouncing their violations, especially on behalf of others. In this sense, we will explore how, when, and why have individuals and groups spoken out, mounted campaigns, produced publications, and more all while referring to a common humanity or notion of human rights. We will also address how such mobilizations intersect with state power and the institutional organization of the contemporary international system. To this end, we will explore the campaign to abolish the slave trade and the development of Amnesty International as two exemplary and foundational moments in the formation of transnational advocacy networks around questions of human rights. This track of the course serves as an introduction to human rights activism as a mode of legal and political practice. The second track (second meetings of the week) involves a practical component that offers a case-specific opportunity to learn about and participate in a human rights advocacy effort. For this component, we will be working with the human rights organization Scholars at Risk (SAR) in their efforts to support detained or threatened Uyghur scholars in China. In this sense, we will learn about the history and contemporary context of the Uyghur community, familiarize ourselves with efforts of SAR and specific Uyghur activists around this issue, and develop a collective contribution to the existing mobilizations around the fate of a specific detained Uyghur scholar (TBD).",92059,Human Rights,https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/hrp.html

This question has gained increasing salience as the world has become more globalized. With globalization new problems surface that cut across national borders and fall outside the jurisdiction of individual nation-states. In response new forms of political organization have emerged to address these problems, which challenge the state as the primary locus of political authority and ultimate source of individual rights. In particular, these individuals and groups have appealed to a kind of global citizenship from below to call for action on and demand redress for the harms created by globalization. This interdisciplinary course critically examines the conceptual and theoretical foundations of the concept of global citizenship and investigates how the idea might work in practice. We begin by considering the conceptual, philosophical and historical debates about citizenship. What does it mean to be a citizen of a particular state? What obligations and responsibilities accompany citizenship? How have understandings of citizenship changed and expanded over time? What is global citizenship and how does it differ from national citizenship? Next we evaluate these ideas about citizenship in the context of globalization and the new problems created by an increasingly interdependent world. Topics covered may include: migration and refugees; the environment and resources; (in)security and borders; health and infectious disease; and development and inequality. We conclude by assessing the role (if any) global citizenship can play in global governance and consider how the international system might be transformed to better address the challenges of globalization.

The observation and description of reality is a fundamental and daunting problem for human rights. This reading and writing seminar explores different methods for the observation and description of complex historical and cultural situations, focusing on the violence and injustice that human rights reporting seeks to expose and challenge. Documenting them is difficult in the extreme. We set out to re-appropriate reality, to get at perception before it has been shaped as expression, to read images and words in the heart and eye before they harden as categories, styles, definitions – and if it is possible to do so, to reconcile the layers of meanings and to pull from all these contradictions some organized proce– where the documentary act begins. We will focus on visual and semiotic awareness, not as an illustration of ideas, but as a seed for ideas in themselves. We will try, through examples and assignments, to investigate how non-professionals can use not only current technologies but also new attitudes so that human rights reporting can be formalized in such a way as to escape its own dreary ghetto and become as serious and as urgent as it ought to be.

This course introduces students to the global history of literature and human rights from the sixteenth century to the present. While human rights are often, and importantly, read through legal documents and declarations, this class will complement the political and juridical traditions of human rights by exploring the central ways in which human rights discourses have been addressed, defined and advanced through literary texts. Beginning with early human rights testimonies around settler colonialism and slavery in the Americas, we will move on to examine twentieth-century literature that grapples with the Holocaust in Europe, military dictatorships in Latin America and Southeast Asia, and Apartheid in South Africa. We will end by considering contemporary texts that confront the issues of war in the Middle East, immigration and detainment, and the treatment of refugees. Throughout the term, we will pose such questions as: what exactly are human rights, and how have they been allocated to particular groups and denied to others in different places and at different times? How can literature appeal to the feelings of empathy and collective recognition necessary to support human rights claims? What strategies do works of art use to bear witness to human rights violations, compel their audiences to act against injustice, and help victims heal? What are the possibilities and limits of the written word in the face of the inarticulable, and of aesthetic representation in the face of atrocity and trauma? In our search for answers, we will examine a range of literary genres, from autobiography and testimony to the graphic novel, drama and poetry.

It is taught in conjunction with the Hannah Arendt Center Fall Conference on Friendship and Politics. In 1936 Hannah Arendt described the German-Jewish author Rahel Varnhagen as her “really best friend, who unfortunately died 100 years ago”. In conversation with her letters her personal writings and with contemporary witnesses, she started her biography Rahel Varnhagen. The Life of a Jewess. Later, in 1945, when Hannah Arendt sent her essay Zionism Reconsidered to Henry Hurwitz, the editor of Menorah Journal, she wrote: “I am afraid of my Zionist friends, that is the truth and not a brave one. But they are the kind of people I never wanted to hurt. It is the old story of amicus Plato, amicus Socrates sed magis amica veritas. Brrrr period!” (A Friend to Plato, A friend to Socrates, but above all a friend to truth. Brrrr period.) This course asks: what is a conversation and how is friendship involved here? And: what is the impact of conversations on the thinking paths of this female thinker? What can we discover when standing in her library, when reading her essays, her letters, when looking at poems dedicated to her? This workshop is also an exploration of different forms of reading. We will start reading Arendt’s ideas of how to live in Dark Times. Exploring Arendt’s personal library on the Bard campus, we will encounter writers and thinkers who were her friends or correspondents, such as W.H. Auden, James Baldwin or Bertolt Brecht; W.E.B. Du Bois, Mary McCarthy, Ralph Ellison, Nathalie Sarraute, Elizabeth Sewell, Socrates and Ted Weiss. During the workshop the students will read different documents from Arendt’s library and send their reflections of the quality and kind of conversation inherent in it.

As Hannah Arendt famously noted, despite claims of universal rights, the ‘right to have rights’ has come to depend on citizenship and nationhood. International human rights makes only minor and narrow concessions to people who cross a border without a government’s permission. As migration increases – because of violence, climate change, economics – the conflict between human rights and border enforcement takes on new proportions, leading to increasingly well documented deaths and violence, both, at the border and beyond. United States border enforcement runs from Central America to bus stations in upstate New York, and meat packing plants in Iowa. And the power of the border police is even extended to policing protesters, as happened in Portland, Oregon and Black Lives Matter protests in 2020. In Europe, border control extends across the Mediterranean sea into the Middle East and across the Sahara. This seminar explores the border’s impact on human rights from the perspective of theory, law and advocacy-related case studies. The class will be begin with readings in political theory and law, drawing from authors including Hannah Arendt, Etienne Balibar, Reece Jones, Linda Bosniak, and Michael Walzer, and will explore the rich debate about borders and refugees elicited by the work of Georgio Agamben. Case studies will highlight the work of researchers and advocates in law, geography, forensic architecture, and humanitarian assistance who are confronting the state directly, as well as anti-immigration or pro-enforcement groups. We will look at the claims made in the name of (universal) human rights to resist and denounce state practices that draw authority from the border, as well as rights claims made in support of border enforcement practices.

HR 3206,"Evidence","Thomas Keenan",4,18,Wed, 10:10, 12:30, "Center for Curatorial Studies",,,,,"MBV, D+J","Literature; Philosophy","","What can culture and the arts teach us about evidence? Evidence would seem to be a matter of facts, far from the realm of literary or artistic invention. But, whether as fact or fiction, we are regularly confronted by all sorts of signs that (might) bear witness to an occurrence. When we read the traces of things left behind at this or that scene, of a crime for instance, questions of interpretation, presentation, even rhetoric, arise immediately. Confronted with evidence, we need to make decisions, form conclusions, reach judgments. This seminar examines various forms of evidence presented in the context of claims made for human rights and justice. On the basis of the traces of what is no longer present—whether in the form of statistics, stains, rubble, graves, documents, photos, videos, social media postings, or testimony—we have to decide, and risk making claims about the truth of what happened. This is necessary because evidence can mislead, or even lie, and is often ignored or suppressed or denied. The complexities of a ‘post-truth’ world, and new modes of political defiance in relation to evidence, make this even more urgent. Through many case studies (from the Shoah to police violence to war crimes to Mediterranean migrant shipwrecks), as well as historical and theoretical accounts, we will examine the centrality of evidence in political and ethical disputes today. Readings include texts and projects by Forensic Architecture, Kate Doyle, Kimberle Crenshaw and Gary Peller, Lawrence Weschler, Shoshana Felman, Judith Butler, Bruno Latour, Eric Stover, Patrick Ball, Ariella Azoulay, Georges Didi-Huberman, and others.",92069,Human Rights,https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/hrp.html

This course will focus on the work and perspectives of people like tour guides, international journalists’ ‘fixers’, interpreters, translators, photojournalists’ image brokers, anthropologists’ key informants, and other cultural liaisons who build their reputations and careers upon moving between cultural worlds. Sometimes the source of much suspicion for possibly betraying their ‘own’, culture brokers are crucial, yet often overlooked, actors who enable the making of international information, humanitarian/human rights reports, news, and cultural knowledge. In contexts of war or conflict, culture brokers become agents whose local knowledge enables them to save lives while also putting their own lives at risk. Focusing on the labor of such culture brokers forces us to ask questions about the constitutive role they play in general understandings and knowledge about ‘the global world.’ We will use a variety of texts, from popular journalism to scholarship about global culture brokers, to examine how cultural knowledge about a specific group or place is produced, by whom, and for what ends.

The third segment of the course analyzes the globalization of Confucian thought during the 16 th through the 19 th centuries, as Jesuit missionary translations of Confucian texts inspired the European Enlightenment and European imperialism sparked Chinese thinkers’ reformulation of “Confucianism” as a bounded, continuous tradition. The fourth segment of the course reconstructs how Confucian thought shaped Western ideas of rights as they entered East Asian politics and explores how Confucian concepts of humanity, relational ethics, and social responsibility may offer alternatives to Euro-American rights discourse.

What happens when memories are borrowed or appropriated? Can one memory be used to lend public visibility to another? This course explores the possibilities and limits of relating different histories of injustice through narratives and theories in and around the aftermath of the Holocaust. Scholarship on “multidirectional memories” has recently emphasized the varied new perspectives on history to be gained from reading memories with respect to their intersectional potential. If we understand memory as a medium for “negotiation, cross-referencing, and borrowing,” Michael Rothberg argues, we can see different traumatic pasts as “productive” for the ways they shape our thinking of the present. In this way, James Baldwin utilized the German past for a play on the construction of Blackness. The German Jewish exile Charlotte Beradt wrote radio reportages on Black political figures that connected scenes of Weimar Germany with anti-racist struggles in America. And the German filmmaker Harun Farocki created montages that layered memories of National Socialism with colonial echoes and contemporary political events such as the Vietnam War. In their work, and in the projects of other transatlantic writers and artists, the permeability of memory as a traveling medium, hidden cargo, and volatile stray substance becomes visible. This course will provide students with a perspective of the postwar moment as a moment of profound exploratory thinking on the politics of relational memory. We will read a number of philosophical and theoretical texts on memory and engage these in conversation with postwar literary texts and films from Europe and the US.",92447,Human Rights,https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/hrp.html

We then turn to the ethics of climate change, with an emphasis on the issue of responsibility. From here, we examine some issues of global justice (e.g., climate refugees and our duties to future generations) as a way of seeing how our duties to the human and non-human might be related.

We lose ourselves in books, escape into t.v. and the internet, and socialize online. Increasingly, we live in virtual worlds. While the rise of the scientific and virtual worlds has led to a great range of advances, most notably in the empirical sciences, the world wide web, and globalization, it has closed off other more physical, local, and embodied ways of feeling and experiencing the things and the people with whom we share this world. In this course, we want to explore various approaches that go beyond the metaphysics of separation. We want to take seriously expressions such as “to know something in your heart,” or “to have a gut feeling,” and “I’m just not feeling into it.” Through readings but also through meditative walks and reflective exercises, we aim to explore the potential truth inherent in embodied and physical ways of knowing. We will cover a wide range of sources – from romanticism to phenomenology to Buddhism and other wisdom traditions – to illuminate the theme.

Anarchy, it is often assumed, makes cooperation among states more difficult, suggests violence and war are inextricable features of the system, and leads to a narrow understanding of power as simple coercion. The resulting picture of international political life is bleak, with states resigned to reproducing patterns of conflict, war, and exploitation. This course—through a critical examination of International Relations’ foundational concepts of anarchy, violence and power—interrogates this rendering of international politics and in doing so provides an introduction to competing theories about the structure, functioning, and transformative potential of the international system. How do states create and maintain order in a condition of anarchy? What forms of political violence are privileged in thinking about international life, and to what effect? How do assumptions about anarchy, and the kinds of politics it encourages, shape how we understand the ways states wield power (in all its forms) to achieve their interests?

Indigent defendants are falsely convicted, and even executed for crimes they did not commit. We say that law is the institutional embodiment of justice. And yet, it is equally true that law, as it is practiced, seems to have little connection to justice. As the novelist William Gaddis writes: “Justice? You get justice in the next world. In this world, you have the law.” This course explores the apparent disconnect between law and justice. Can contemporary legal systems offer justice? Can we, today, still speak of a duty to obey the law? Is it possible for law to do justice? Through readings of legal cases as well as political, literary, and philosophical texts, we seek to understand the problem of administering justice as it emerges in the context of contemporary legal institutions.

In this seminar about the global politics of backsliding we will explore the meaning of the concept of backsliding and its reach in global politics. We will also examine the main drivers underpinning backsliding in democratic states, including pernicious polarization, the implosion of neoliberalism, the “dark-side” of globalization, and misinformation campaigns against democracy by China and Russia.

The decade would end with a global financial meltdown and the country still fighting unpopular wars.

An Anthology of Asian American Writers arrived on the U.S. literary scene in 1974, it was both manifesto and provocation, inflaming still-ongoing debates over the borders, sensibilities, obligations, and political allegiances of the “Asian American writer.” Since the entrance of Aiiieeeee and the beginnings of the Asian American Movement in the late 1960’s, Asian American poetry has expanded to cover vast political and aesthetic terrain, though knotted questions remain over what designating a work as “Asian American” allows us to see and understand. In this course, we’ll examine the aesthetic heterogeneity and capaciousness of this slippery category through the lens of contemporary AAPI and Asian diaspora poets who write in invigoratingly diverse modes, forms, styles, and visions. How do contemporary AAPI poets innovate poetically to address evolving concerns of the AAPI community? How do works by these poets deepen or destabilize our understanding of race and racialization? Course readings will include the poetry of Nellie Wong, Garrett Hongo, Theresa Cha, Bhanu Kapil, Rajiv Mohabir, Monica Youn, Vijay Seshadri, Li-Young Lee, Solmaz Sharif, John Yau, Sarah Howe, Sally Wen Mao, Monica Sok, Hieu Minh Nguyen, Craig Santos Perez, Timothy Yu, and more. The class will also feature writings by Anne Anlin Cheng, Viet Thanh Ngyuen, Hua Hsu, and Cathy Park Hong as critical frameworks for our conversations around race, form, and intersections between politics and aesthetics. In tandem with the course texts, students will write their own poetry, and engage in interdisciplinary modes of response.

Our literature, in other words, will be read against the backdrop of the two World Wars and Vietnam; of the feminist, Civil Rights, and Black Arts movements; of secularization and the sexual revolution; and of the burgeoning social sciences and the “linguistic turn.” After exploring the varieties of modernism in American literature, we will attempt to characterize the postmodern: Is postmodernism a break with modernism or an accentuation of elements latent in modernism itself? Is it a cultural mood, a structural feature of late capitalism, or a programmatic literary mode?

It has come to be praised on all sides, however, it has not been understood as much as it has been admired. We will investigate the theory underpinning civil society, with its origins in the Scottish Enlightenment and the US Constitution, then trace these threads through the rise of the not-for-profit sector and focus on the principles of best practice for organizations generating significant social impact. The end of the Cold War and the collapse of most socialist states sparked international enthusiasm in the 1990s for the building of civil society by means of voluntary non-profit activity, in the belief that strong civil societies would promote democracy. No one has advanced this principle more aggressively over the past thirty years than billionaire philanthropist George Soros and his Open Society Foundations, whose work is based on the philosophy of Karl Popper. The renewal of civil society in Central and Eastern Europe was met with enthusiasm in the 1990s, yet over the last decade has been met with resistance and even hostility by political leadership pivoting toward illiberal democracy and authoritarianism.

In more recent years, new actors including civil society, philanthropy, and the private sector have been engaged to bring new perspectives, broaden outreach, and improve program implementation. But recent crises have tested the ability of these institutions to manage change and develop solutions. The global coronavirus pandemic, climate change, inequality and injustice, the decline of democracies, rapid technological change, rising food and commodity prices, and increased refugee and migration flows—these global challenges require global solutions. Yet many wonder whether the United Nations and international institutions are up to the task. Amid the strain that these challenges already posed on global institutions and support for global cooperation, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has raised fundamental questions about their existence and continued legitimacy. This course aims to equip students with a better understanding of when and why global institutions work and what it takes to make global policy effective. We will examine the roles, responsibilities, and effectiveness of international institutions in helping to manage global crises, and how the Biden Administration, UN officials, or other decision-makers should respond. We will study successes and failures of multilateralism, whether the system is working the way it was designed to, and the role that governments, civil society, and others play in its effectiveness.

In this course we’ll explore “democratic backsliding” from a global perspective, what is meant by the term, what it looks like, and why it seems to be happening so widely right now. We’ll look at factors contributing to the rise of the far right, sources of support for illiberal politics, and whether this politics offers real solutions to actual problems. Some critics argue that the concept itself of “illiberal democracy” is an oxymoron. But therein lie some of the difficulties facing liberal societies: where and how do we draw a distinction between legitimate disputes among parties within a democratic community, and behaviors that damage, and potentially destroy, the system itself? Readings for this course will be interdisciplinary, drawing on critical texts on democratic erosion, from Daniel Ziblatt and Steven Levitsky, and Ivan Krastev and Stephen Holmes, as well as recent theoretical writings on democracy, its vulnerabilities, and limits, from Patrick Deneen and Roger Scruton, and journalistic works, such as those by Anne Applebaum and Isabel Wilkerson. We will examine case studies, and students will complete a final assignment that may be devoted to one such case study, an essay or journalistic piece, or another writing project to be determined with the instructor. An underlying line of inquiry in this class will be to consider whether (or not) we may be entering into a “post-liberal” era, and what that might mean for the future of the democratic institutions – the media, civil society, schools and universities, museums, the courts – within which many of us will seek to make our careers and our public lives.",92408,BGIA Courses (NYC),https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/bgia.html

This course invites students into the discipline of philosophy through a critical consideration of its origins in ancient Greece. Philosophy emerged in the sixth and fifth centuries BCE in a context of rapid urbanization, expanding literacy, colonial warfare, and democratic experimentation. Without any established academic disciplines or traditions, the early Greek thinkers we now call the “first philosophers” experimented with an astonishing variety of forms and practices, including scientific observation, cryptic aphorisms, poetic narratives, and dramatic dialogue. As we follow the emergence of distinctively “philosophical” ways of thinking and living, we will also trace the shifting relations of philosophy to other modes of thought in ancient Greek culture, such as poetry, religion, theater, and politics. The course centers on the enigmatic figure of Socrates, in whose intellectual circle the term “philosophy” first came into common use. We will consider the conflicting accounts of Socrates and his circle that we find in the historian Xenophon, the comedian Aristophanes, and the tragedian Plato. Alongside this paradigmatic philosopher, we will also consider other thinkers who have a more contested relationship to the philosophical canon, including the so-called “Presocratics” and the Sophists. In taking up the question of who counts as a philosopher and what counts as philosophy in Greek antiquity, we will attend to the role of class, gender and sexuality in the formation of philosophical communities.

Drawing neat historical divisions in thought can be tricky, yet this course offers students the opportunity to examine these movements with sufficient context to identify Poststructuralism’s debts to Structuralism, as well as its critical departures. The course is divided into four parts. 1) We begin by examining core ideas of structuralism that develop in the field of linguistics (Saussure, Jakobson, Benvéniste) and tackle the basic structuralist proposition that beneath the variable surface phenomena of human culture there exist governing relations of abstract structure. 2) Pursuing the idea that human culture can be grasped by means of deep structures modeled on language, we turn to examine authors who adapt structural analysis for disciplines beyond linguistics, including anthropology (Lévi-Strauss), Marxism (Althusser), literature (Barthes), and psychoanalysis (Lacan). 3) We then turn to social constructionism and consider how Foucault views power and knowledge to operate in historical constructions of the subject. 4) Beginning with an overview of structuralism’s perceived limitations, for the remainder of the course we grapple with some core concerns in poststructuralist thought, such as the instability of meaning in language (Derrida), capitalism and desire (Deleuze, Guattari, Lyotard), reality and simulation, (Baudrillard), identity and difference, including questions of sexual difference and gender construction (Irigaray, Kristeva, Cixous, Butler). The course aims to familiarize students with a range of poststructuralist methodologies, including conceptual analysis, historicism, social constructionism, discourse analysis, schizoanalysis, écriture féminine, and deconstruction.

His later Philosophical Investigations, written in an informal and instructive manner, but no less confidently assertive, systematically exposed his younger position which he condemned for being formalistic and self-deceivingly detached from the natural functioning of language. In its place, Wittgenstein offered an expansive account of the social nature of meaning which has influenced generations of philosophers.

Poets, philosophers, and poetic thinkers—from Goethe and Kant, to Kleist and Schlegel, or from Nietzsche, Rilke, and Hofmannsthal, to writers of the Avant-Garde, and on to Wittgenstein, Aichinger and Arendt—have all had something to say on these questions. The beauty and precision of their language(s) will foster our analytical vocabulary and will (we hope!) inspire ambitious and playful writing experiments, including regular translation exercises, to generate a semester of joyful conversations with these thinkers of and in the German language.",92462,Philosophy,https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/philosophy.html

The geographic focus will be the towns, cities, and peasant communes of the Italian and German speaking regions of Europe, particularly the Italian peninsula, Holy Roman Empire, and Switzerland. Two apparently opposed developments will be at the center of our approach: first, the role of the autonomous peasant commune, particularly in Switzerland, as a model and spur for political forms such as democracy and anarchism; second, the development of modern capitalism and technology as they came to impinge on the traditional feudal and communal orders. The course will also address the historiography and politics surrounding the “invention” of the Renaissance in the late nineteenth century, looking particularly at Burckhardt’s relation with Ranke, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche.",92449,Historical Studies,https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/history.html

This class aims to explore the country’s (questionably) sudden return to imperialist ambitions and Cold-War-style isolation from an analytical perspective. Why was the period of openness so brief? How are Russia’s international politics influenced by the nation’s historical experiences and internal political and economic crises? And to what extent do the “Putinist” decades of Russia’s presence on the global stage depend on this president’s personal opinions, cultural background, and geopolitical desires? Starting with Gorbachev’ Perestroika, which amalgamated paradigms of Soviet foreign relations with an attempt to resolve internal issues, we will move on to investigating the two major upheavals: the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the crash of the Yalta-Potsdam system. These historical milestones will help us frame the Russian foreign affairs of the early 1990s as a continuation of the Soviet foreign policy, with its focus on cooperation with the West. Our next subject will be such turning points of post-Soviet foreign policy transformation as the Primakov Loop over the Atlantic (1999) and Putin’ Munich Speech (2007). Making a quick detour to the history of Soviet national politics, we will then proceed to map Russia’s historical path to the current war with Ukraine. Each class will include a study of primary historical documents. Course readings will incorporate the theoretical works on “Soft Power” by Joseph S. Nye, Jr., Yasushi Watanabe, and David L. McConnell; essays on foreign diplomacy by Henry Kissinger, Hans Morgenthau, and Iver B.

The immediate need for solutions places pressure on land-managers and policy-makers to translate relevant scientific findings into action, perhaps before clear answers emerge in the scientific literature. The trajectory and tempo of scientific progress often include periods of ambiguity during which scientists reach opposing conclusions, debating publicly in the primary literature over months or years as new studies emerge. At times, these debates can become contentious, in part because of constraints inherent to the study of ecology that limit the broad application of ecological results across different ecosystems, and in part because answers differ from our previous understanding, or have little public appeal. In this course, students will examine current controversies in the ecological literature.

What does it mean to think about political modes of living together through the lens of “friendship”? How is this different from political thinking that focuses on neighboring terms like solidarity, community, fraternity, family, or love? We will be reading from various genres – philosophy, poetry, essay, drama, letters—and asking how different forms of writing may affect our conception of friendship. Reading both canonical and less well-known works from various languages and traditions, we will consider how differences in social and cultural context (including citizenship status, class, race, religion) as well as gender norms may shape the idea and practice of friendship. Two guiding concerns will be the connection between friendship and plurality and, relatedly, the relationship between the one and the many. To what extent, for example, is solitude a condition for a life in plurality? And how has the internet altered what we mean by friends?

From Rousseau’s ambitious program of autobiography to Ndiaye’s project of paranoid self-portraiture, literature in French has staged with relish the classic tension between art, artifice, and authenticity and the ways in which this tension relates to forms of politics, power and postcoloniality. This has not only inaugurated an intensely individual and unstable relationship to the notion of truth, but has implicated the reader in this destabilizing process. This class will explore how the quest for authenticity has led to radical reevaluations of literary style. Readings from Rousseau, Lamartine, Hugo, Balzac, Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Apollinaire, Édouard, Ponge, Sartre, Camus, Ernaux, Chamoiseau, Condé, Ndiaye, and others. Taught in French.

It divorces leisure from labor and turns life into a series of utilitarian dead ends. Conversely, the impulse to play, to engage in gratuitous moments of being, in seemingly evanescent conversations, might be our only chance to convert specialized knowledge into self-knowledge. Since Socrates, conversation has been admired for its seemless ability to perform thinking, to integrate knowledge into society, and to supplement savoir (knowledge) with savoir-vivre (the art of living). But conversation, precisely because it clashes with the useful, has often been condemned as merely artful, dangerous for its proximity to the decadent and the idle. But what is so threatening about idleness? According to Nietzsche, because idleness leads to self-reflection, we avoid it by mindlessly embracing work. The work ethic has become an excuse for not thinking about the desperate human condition.. Paradoxically, work has become an escapist diversion and the time to rest and to converse has being usurped by the false plenitude of mechanical labor. Proust’s In Search of Lost Time adds a new twist to this dichotomy: for the social-climber, conversation becomes work, a laborious exercise in appearing rather than being. This course examines how these tensions are played both on a rhetorical (we will read diverse narratological studies on conversation, studying the use of silences, repetition, dialogue, etc.) and on a thematic level. After reading a selection of critiques of ‘pure’ work (Aristotle, Schiller, Marx, and Nietzsche), we will examine texts that expose the vanity of conversation (Pascal’s Pensées, Molière’s Misanthrope), novels that thematize the tensions between work and conversation as social and cultural phenomena (Henry James, The Europeans, Updike Rabbit Run), and works that offer up possible aesthetic theories of conversation (Proust, Swann’s Way and Against Sainte Beuve). We will also scrutinize instances where conversation becomes a mere filler (Beckett’s Waiting for Godot). Students will also read Paul Lafargue’s In Praise of Idleness and Corinne Maier’s Laziness, the recent French bestseller attacking the dangers of work.

Topics for discussion will include the science of attention, the uses of ritual and repetition, “the discipline of rightness” (as Wallace Stevens once described it), and why feeling so often precedes form. Readings/viewings will include work by Natalia Ginzburg, Rainer Marie Rilke, Virginia Woolf, Francis Ponge, Henri Lefebvre, Teju Cole, Jonathan Crary, Claudia Rankine, Joy Williams, Mierle Laderman Ukeles, John Cage, Gaston Bachelard and Tehching Hsieh among others. Over the course of the semester, we will use these texts and artworks as a springboard for writing our own original texts.",92468,Written Arts,https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/writers.html
WRIT 405,"Written Arts Senior Colloquium",". TBA",1,30,Mon, 17:40, 19:00, "Reem Kayden Center 103",,,,,"PA","","","The Senior Colloquium in the Written Arts is an important supplement to the Senior Project. It has several objectives: intellectual/artistic, social, and vocational. The primary purpose is to guide seniors, both practically and philosophically, in the daunting task of creating a coherent and inspired creative work of high quality within a single academic year. Emphasis is on demystifying the project process, including its bureaucratic hurdles, as well as exploring the role of research in the creative realm, and helping students use each other as a critical and inspirational resource during this protracted solitary endeavor, sharing works in progress when appropriate. This supplements but never supplants the primary and sacrosanct role of the project adviser. Program faculty and alumni/ae, career development and other staff, and outside speakers (such as editors, translators, MFA graduates and directors, publishing personnel, etc.) contribute their collective wisdom and experience, sharing the myriad ways in which writers move an idea toward full creative realization, and giving a glimpse of the kinds of internships and careers available to the writer. Required for students enrolled in a Written Arts Senior Project. All such students are enrolled automatically by the Registrar.",92179,Written Arts,https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/writers.html

LIT 323,"Lolita: Nabokov and the Language of Desire","Olga Voronina",4,15,Mon, 12:30, 14:50, "Olin 307",,,,,"LA","","","This course invites students to contemplate the legendary eroticism of Nabokov’s masterwork not only as a matter of plot, characterization, or dialogue, but also as a linguistic phenomenon. The aesthetics of sexual desire for Nabokov is inseparable from language – a physiological, cognitive, and symbolic medium that can affect the reader both on the level of sound (alliteration, friction, tension, etc.) as well as through figurative speech, with its multiplicity of connotations and allusions (hidden messages are like taboos: we desire to break them). Lolita, the novel we will be reading and re-reading in class, was written in English, which Nabokov acquired and adopted, rather than being born into. We will investigate the impact Nabokov’s complicated relationship with the language had on his writing techniques and stylistic choices. We will also explore strategies of narrative concealment Nabokov used in order to seduce, mislead, and even morally blind his readers. Among the texts offered for study and discussion, there will be Lolita’s prototexts, such as fairy-tales and Arthurian legends; works by William Shakespeare, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Edgar Allan Poe, Lewis Carroll, and John Ruskin; Russian classical literature (Fyodor Dostoevsky, Leo Tostoy, Anton Chekhov); German, French, and American pulp fiction; and the author’s own novels and short stories, either written in English (Bend Sinister, “A Fairy-Tale”, “Colette”) or self-translated from the Russian (Laughter in the Dark).

LIT 334,"Fantastika and the New Gothic","Bradford Morrow",4,15,Mon, 12:30, 14:50, "Olin 101",,,,,"LA","","","The critical boundaries between literary and genre fiction have become increasingly biguous over the past several decades, thanks to the liberating and bitious work by a number of pioneering writers. Traditional gothic authors including Horace Walpole, Ann Radcliffe, Matthew Gregory Lewis, Mary Shelley, Sara Coleridge, E. A. Poe, the Brontë sisters, Br Stoker, and others framed their tales within the metaphoric landscapes of ruined abbeys and diabolic grottoes, chthonic settings populated by protagonists whose troubled psyches led them far beyond the verges of propriety and sanity. While embracing the se fundentally dark artistic vision, later masters radically reinvented and contemporized tropes, settings, and narrative strategies to create a new era in this tradition. Identified as the New Gothic, this phase appears to have risen in tandem with a parallel literary phenomenon, termed by speculative fiction theorist John Clute as Fantastika, whose achievement is to have taken the genres of the fantastic, fabular, and horror in a similar groundbreaking literary direction. While not dismissing the fundamental spirit that animates its genre forebears, writers such as Angela Carter, Kazuo Ishiguro, Cormac McCarthy, N. K. Jemisin, Joyce Carol Oates, Kelly Link, Carmen Maria Machado, Karen Russell, Sofia Satar, Julia Elliott, George Saunders, and Elizabeth Hand have created a body of serious literary fiction that we will focus on in this course. Several authors will join us in person and via Zoom to discuss their work with the class. Students in this course will have the opportunity to meet in class with three major writers in this field and discuss their work, Brian Evenson, Kelly Link, and Elizabeth Hand (we will be among the first to read Hand’s authorized sequel to Shirley Jackson’s masterpiece, The Haunting of Hill House).",92152,300 and 400 Level Courses,https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/lit3courses.html

In this course we will closely examine a variety of short texts in order to investigate such questions and to think about the different roles a reader might assume in order to productively interpret a “difficult” or “easy” text: decoder, technician, philologist, ideologue, initiate, psychoanalyst, aesthete, and so forth. In this way, we will lay a foundation for literary theory and develop strategies for engaging with writings that are often deemed to be too forbidding (or too simple) for our attention. Readings could include the Gospel of St. Mark and work by Thomas Browne, the Grimm brothers, James Joyce, Hermann Broch, Gertrude Stein, Sylvia Plath, Emmanuel Levinas, John Ashbery, Lydia Davis, Annie Dillard, and Arnold Lobel (author of the Frog and Toad books).",92153,300 and 400 Level Courses,https://inside.bard.edu/academic/courses/fall2023/lit3courses.html

A broad survey of British literature and culture from the early 19th through the late 20th century, with readings organized according to three interconnected themes. First, the expansion, critique, and eventual dissolution of the British Empire, with its concomitant effects on colonized (and later postcolonial) peoples around the globe. Next, Britain’s rapid industrialization and the resultant shifts in humanity’s relationship to the natural world, partly reflected in scientific and ecological writing. Finally, the widening of equality, particularly in terms of class and gender, with its attendant social and political upheavals. We will consider how literature interacted with these developments, looking at various literary movements and a range of evolutions in form, genre, and style.
